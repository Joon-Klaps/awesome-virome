- [ICTV Virus Metadata Resource (VMR)](https://talk.ictvonline.org/taxonomy/vmr/) - Curated database of sequences of exemplars for each classified virus species. [Reference](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5753373/)

- [NCBI RefSeq](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/) - Curated database of annotated genomic, transcript, and protein sequence records: viruses (ca. 8500 complete viral genomes), prokaryotes, eukaryotes. [Reference](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4702849/)

- [NCBI GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) - Uncurated database of all publicly available nucleotide sequences, annotated. [Reference](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC148087/)

- [Reference Viral DataBase (RVDB), nucleic version](https://rvdb.dbi.udel.edu/) - Curated database of virus nucleotide sequences, available as Unclustered (U-) and Clustered (C-) nucleotide sequence files. Sequences determined to be irrelevant for virus detection are removed. [Reference](https://journals.asm.org/doi/epub/10.1128/mspheredirect.00069-18)

- [Reference Viral DataBase (RVDB), protein version](https://rvdb-prot.pasteur.fr/) - Protein version (RVDB-prot and RVDB-prot-HMM) of the curated U-RVDB described above. [Reference](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7492780/)

- [SIB Viral reference sequences](https://viralzone.expasy.org/6096) - Curated database of annotated viral genomes generated by the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB), including all sequences annotated as complete viral genomes (ca. 70,000) downloaded from GenBank (query "VRL[Division] AND 'complete genome' [ALL]") and subsequently screened for several criteria. [Reference](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6770386/)

- [UniProt Virus proteomes](https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/) - Curated and annotated database of proteomic virus references (ca. 10,000 virus reference proteomes). [Reference](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/D1/D506/5160987?login=true)

- [VirMet](https://github.com/medvir/VirMet) - In-house database download from GenBank (query txid10239[orgn] AND ("complete genome"[Title] OR srcdb_refseq[prop]) NOT wgs[PROP] NOT "cellular organisms"[Organism] NOT AC_000001[PACC]: AC_999999[PACC]". [Reference](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/10/9/661)

- [Virosaurus](https://viralzone.expasy.org/8676) - Curated database of virus sequences for clinical metagenomics, clustered (non-redundant), vertebrate viruses (ca. 24,000 sequences) can be downloaded separately or combined with non-vertebrate viruses. [Reference](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/11/1248)

- [Virus Pathogen Resource (ViPR)](https://www.viprbrc.org/) - Curated database of virus pathogens (ca. 1,000,000 genomes from ca. 7000 species) in the NIAD Category Aâ€“C Priority Pathogen lists and those causing (re)emerging infectious diseases. External sources: GenBank, UniProt, Immune Epitope Database, Protein Data Bank, etc. [Reference](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3509690/)

- [Virion](https://github.com/viralemergence/virion) - An open database of vertebrate-virus interactions.
