      "abstract": "<jats:p>Exoplanets observations with small and medium scale telescopes are becoming more and more popular among amateur astronomers, students and early career scientists as they do not require extremely sophisticated instrumentation. However, and important barrier between observing and producing scientifically valid results is the data analysis and modelling. To assist observers towards this aspect and make it possible for more people to contribute to scientific research I developed HOPS (HOlomon Photometric Software), a python-based package which includes a user interface and it is compatible with Linux, OS X and Windows. It is open-source (github.com/ExoWorldsSpies/hops) and it is designed to analyse data from small and medium class telescopes. HOPS is a user-friendly package where graphic representations, statistics and models are brought together into a single package. With these characteristics, HOPS can be used by amateur astronomers individually or as part of citizen science projects or as an educational for university or school students. In this presentation I will describe the newest version of the code (v3.0) and an educational version designed for high school students.</jats:p>",
