This document outlines the updated engagement objectives, evolving stakeholder&nbsp;groups, engagement channels, risks, and the roles and responsibilities of DigiNEB&rsquo;s partners.</p>\n<p>The DigiNEB platform aims to deepen stakeholder understanding of the New European Bauhaus,&nbsp;keep stakeholders informed of key developments, contribute to the NEB digital transformation, and&nbsp;disseminate NEB best practices. It also fosters cross-disciplinary and cross-sectoral collaboration,&nbsp;monitors the overall impact of NEB activities, and contributes to policy development and&nbsp;standardisation.</p>\n<p>In 2023, DigiNEB played a pivotal role in rallying the NEB community around the NEB Mission,&nbsp;engaging Member States to support it during a key meeting at the Council of Europe on the 12th of&nbsp;September 2023. Following this, DigiNEB gathered eminent leaders from NEB Labs and Lighthouses&nbsp;to co-author a White Paper. This document, which was included as an annexe in deliverable D4.2,&nbsp;provides strategic direction for the NEB Mission&rsquo;s evolution and its eventual transition towards the&nbsp;NEB Facility, a future-focused funding mechanism. The White Paper captures the insights of thought&nbsp;leaders from across the NEB ecosystem and serves as a foundational guide for shaping the NEB's&nbsp;future, policy, and initiatives.</p>\n<p>This final version of the updated Stakeholder Engagement Plan moves beyond addressing the initial&nbsp;catalogue of distinct target groups - architects, designers, educators, etc. Based on insights from the&nbsp;project&rsquo;s first phase and in consultation with partners, the plan has adopted a more flexible,&nbsp;mission-driven approach. This strategy unites multidisciplinary communities around topics of shared&nbsp;interest, following successful models from NEB projects such as Bauhaus of the Seas Sails, Nordic&nbsp;Carbon-Neutral Bauhaus, and Bauhaus Goes South. Aligning DigiNEB with these core themes has&nbsp;proven effective for onboarding large stakeholder pools, encouraging cross-sectoral collaboration,&nbsp;and promoting co-creation.</p>\n<p>Since the project amendment and refocus, a major upgrade to the DigiNEB website provides a more&nbsp;intuitive and user-friendly interface, enhancing stakeholder access to valuable resources such as the&nbsp;NEB Concepts modular podcast. The revamped website now functions as a central hub for&nbsp;stakeholders, offering improved navigation, interactive learning tools, and databases that support&nbsp;co-creation activities.</p>\n<p>The DigiNEB project is actively connecting with industry partners, European Digital Innovation Hubs&nbsp;(including Link&ouml;ping Science Park), the EU Capital of Innovation (Link&ouml;ping, Sweden), and a range of&nbsp;digital projects in alignment with the objectives set out in the Description of Action (DOA). Through&nbsp;the digital technical working groups/digital focus groups, a broad spectrum of stakeholders from&nbsp;different EU member and associated states has been engaged.</p>\n<p>The NEB Concepts modular podcast was created to respond to challenges in sustaining meaningful&nbsp;engagement through traditional social media. It offers a modular approach, allowing users to explore&nbsp;themes such as sustainability, design, and innovation in a flexible format that promotes deeper&nbsp;learning and engagement. This podcast represents a shift toward more substantive, long-term&nbsp;engagement strategies, moving away from the transient nature of social media.</p>\n<p>This version of the deliverable includes a substantial new section (Section 5) that reports on the final&nbsp;event of the DigiNEB project in Brussels. &lsquo;Celebrating the Lessons Learnt&rsquo; brought together 64&nbsp;thought leaders from across the wider NEB community, including Lighthouses, Labs and other&nbsp;Coordination Actions as well as policymakers. The final event also featured dynamic discussions in a&nbsp;series of 'Think and Do Tanks' to reflect on lessons learnt and formulate concrete policy&nbsp;recommendations for the NEB roadmap. These outcomes are detailed in Section 5.13.</p>\n<p>The final event launched the published Regional Innovation Model (RIM) Handbook, based on NEB&nbsp;community activities with regional governments and using the Jan &Aring;man and Adam Davies Prototype&nbsp;for an Ecosystemic Handbook as a foundation. The RIM Handbook is designed to be a companion to&nbsp;city and regional administrators. It includes practical examples of engagement and activities for local&nbsp;actors and changemakers in collaboration across sectors and disciplines. It suggests ways to think&nbsp;about grand challenges that address specific needs and characteristics of regional ecosystems while&nbsp;it offers support instruments and frameworks to leverage local intelligence and create a systemic&nbsp;shift at the global scale.</p>\n<p>By focusing on ecosystemic approaches to regional development, the handbook ensures that the&nbsp;NEB community can benefit from proven methodologies and tools that drive innovation and&nbsp;collaboration across Europe. The handbook&rsquo;s launch was further supported by commitments from&nbsp;policymakers, including the plan for a second major launch event at the European Committee of the&nbsp;Regions yearly Plenary in April 2025. This strategic dissemination ensures the handbook&rsquo;s reach&nbsp;extends to policymakers across Europe, amplifying its utility as a cornerstone of regional NEB-aligned&nbsp;innovation.</p>\n<p>In addition to these resources, the project has undergone significant development, including&nbsp;redesigning the DigiNEB website to provide a more intuitive and accessible hub for stakeholders.&nbsp;This upgraded platform offers enhanced features such as interactive learning tools, improved&nbsp;navigation, and the integration of digital co-creation methodologies.&nbsp;Stakeholder engagement has evolved significantly, culminating in the joint event with CrAFt and&nbsp;NEBula at Architect House in Brussels and the knowledge exchange at the JUST Industry Data Week&nbsp;in Link&ouml;ping. The project&rsquo;s engagement strategy emphasises data ethics and AI for social good,&nbsp;integrating these themes into broader discussions around sustainability and digital transformation.</p>\n<p>These efforts are aligned with the project's goal of fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and&nbsp;supporting the NEB mission at the European level. This deliverable underscores the integration of&nbsp;digital and co-creation methodologies into the broader NEB mission, leveraging insights from events&nbsp;such as the JUST Industry Data Week and the final Brussels event.</p>",

This document, which is included as an annex to this&nbsp;report, provides strategic direction for the NEB Mission&rsquo;s evolution and its eventual transition&nbsp;towards the NEB Facility, a future-focused funding mechanism. The White Paper captures the&nbsp;insights of thought leaders from across the NEB ecosystem and serves as a foundational guide for&nbsp;shaping the NEB's future, policy, and initiatives.</p>\n<p>This updated Stakeholder Engagement Plan moves beyond addressing the initial catalogue of distinct&nbsp;target groups - architects, designers, educators, etc. Based on insights from the project&rsquo;s first phase&nbsp;and in consultation with partners, the plan has adopted a more flexible, mission-driven approach.

This podcast represents a shift&nbsp;toward more substantive, long-term engagement strategies, moving away from the transient nature&nbsp;of social media.</p>\n<p>The Handbook for Ecosystemic Regional Innovation further supports DigiNEB&rsquo;s mission by offering&nbsp;local and regional leaders practical guidance on how to implement NEB principles within their own&nbsp;contexts. By focusing on ecosystemic approaches to regional development, the handbook ensures that&nbsp;the NEB community can benefit from proven methodologies and tools that drive innovation and&nbsp;collaboration across Europe.</p>\n<p>In addition to these resources, the project has undergone significant development, including the&nbsp;redesign of the DigiNEB website to provide a more intuitive and accessible hub for stakeholders. This&nbsp;upgraded platform offers enhanced features such as interactive learning tools, improved navigation,&nbsp;and the integration of digital co-creation methodologies.</p>\n<p>DigiNEB established a repository after the NEB@CERN event, providing an ongoing resource for&nbsp;the NEB community. This platform, initially created to support collaboration following the event,&nbsp;has led to ongoing interaction by that community of contributors, hosted by sister projects such as&nbsp;CrAft and the NEB Academy. The community unified by this milestone event at CERN has&nbsp;maintained regular dialogue, collaboration and interaction, driving forward the collective NEB&nbsp;vision.</p>\n<p>Stakeholder engagement has evolved significantly, with new strategies focusing on collaboration,&nbsp;community participation, and co-creation. Key NEB stakeholders, including policymakers, industry&nbsp;leaders, and civil society, have been actively involved in the development of best practices for regional&nbsp;innovation. The project&rsquo;s engagement strategy now emphasises data ethics and AI for social good,&nbsp;integrating these themes into broader discussions around sustainability and digital transformation.&nbsp;These efforts are aligned with the project's goal of fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and&nbsp;supporting the NEB mission at the European level.</p>\n<p>Stakeholder engagement remains a shared responsibility of all DigiNEB consortium members.&nbsp;Leveraging existing networks and connections remains a core aspect of the project&rsquo;s outreach&nbsp;strategy. Each partner continues to focus on specific areas of engagement, ensuring that the project&nbsp;benefits from a diverse range of strengths and avoids duplication of efforts. Stakeholder engagement&nbsp;has also been conducted in parallel lines of community interaction, by participation in broad interest&nbsp;community activities of DigiNEB project partners. This collaborative approach, paired with the&nbsp;updated tools and methodologies outlined in this document, positions DigiNEB to foster&nbsp;interdisciplinary collaboration and advance the NEB&rsquo;s mission effectively.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The digiNEB.eu project supports the implementation of the New European Bauhaus (NEB) and the&nbsp;speeding up of the green transformation by increasing the adoption of NEB digital solutions.&nbsp;digiNEB.eu is a Coordination Action, and as such, it is imperative to identify and understand&nbsp;stakeholder needs to respond to them and provide the required knowledge support, networking,&nbsp;upskilling and community participation. This document outlines the engagement objectives, target&nbsp;stakeholder groups, engagement channels, risks, and partners' engagement roles and responsibilities&nbsp;for the digiNEB.eu initiative.</p>\n<p>The digiNEB.eu platform aims to increase stakeholder understanding of the New European Bauhaus,&nbsp;keep stakeholders well-informed, contribute to the digital transformation, disseminate NEB best&nbsp;practices, enable cross-disciplinary and cross-sectoral collaboration, monitor the global impact of NEB&nbsp;and inform standardisation and policy.</p>\n<p>The Stakeholder Engagement Plan goes beyond addressing a catalogue of the traditional target groups&nbsp;that might ordinarily be expected when joining digital stakeholders with particular areas of specialism&nbsp;(architects, designers, educators&hellip;). Following partner consultations, the plan has been evolved with&nbsp;a new approach that draws together multidisciplinary communities around a series of topics of&nbsp;common interest. This approach builds upon an effective NEB strategy established in NEB projects&nbsp;such as Nordic Carbon-Neutral Bauhaus and Bauhaus Goes South. Each of these has developed a large&nbsp;stakeholder pool around a central theme that different stakeholders relate to. Aligning topics around&nbsp;the missions of these established communities provides an effective method for onboarding large&nbsp;numbers of NEB stakeholders. The aim is to align multiple and diverse digital technology research&nbsp;communities with these established NEB communities; build trust, encourage engagement,&nbsp;particularly between silos; and ensure two-way dialogues and multidisciplinary co-creation rather&nbsp;than simply one-way dissemination.</p>\n<p>Following this onboarding strategy, the proposed Technology Working Groups (TWGs) have been&nbsp;reframed around topics and renamed as Thematic Working Groups. This allows digiNEB.eu to build on&nbsp;NEB&rsquo;s mission-driven strategy and gather digital and NEB communities around a series of common&nbsp;themes, allowing for greater inclusivity and contributions beyond the specific categories of&nbsp;stakeholders identified in the project proposal, divided into seven categories (architects, construction&nbsp;industry, researchers, policymakers, etc.). The first event that will test this method of onboarding&nbsp;communities is being hosted by CERN IdeaSquare and will gather 50 NEB and digital stakeholders inperson&nbsp;over 2.5 days in co-creation workshops.</p>\n<p>The digiNEB.eu project has already implemented and is in the process of further implementing&nbsp;knowledge exchange and matchmaking events, webinars, educational seminars and hands-on&nbsp;innovation labs, place-based education, social media, and the activation and empowerment of early&nbsp;adopters. Results from engagement and knowledge creation will be transferred to the digital platform,&nbsp;which will provide databases, catalogues and toolkits. It will conduct community-building events,&nbsp;incentivise Early Adopters as ambassadors, publish success stories, offer a useful co-creation space&nbsp;along with valuable digital resources and assets, and amplify impacts through social media channels.</p>\n<p>Engagement with stakeholders will be the responsibility of all members of the digiNEB.eu consortium.&nbsp;Linking with partners&rsquo; existing networks and connections will be a central aspect of this outreach. In&nbsp;addition, each partner will have a specific focal area to share the workload and leverage key strengths,&nbsp;as well as to avoid duplication.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This document outlines the Early Adopters Network for national and regional adoption of the digiNEB&nbsp;project. It defines Early Adopters as stakeholders who have actively and positively engaged with digital&nbsp;strategies in conjunction with NEB projects and NEB-aligned initiatives. A total of 134 Early Adopters have&nbsp;been successfully onboarded, exceeding the original targets (KPI: 100). These individuals have become&nbsp;champions for the project, actively contributing to the promotion of NEB principles, educational&nbsp;methodologies and digital tools compiled by the project.</p>\n<p>With the project&rsquo;s aim to join NEB and smart digital communities, the NEB@CERN 3-day event was&nbsp;achieved as an early milestone, 4 months earlier than planned, to bring together NEB and smart&nbsp;communities thought leaders and stakeholders around future directions for learning, digital and strategies&nbsp;for EU regions. As a high-level co-creation series of Think and Do Tanks, it provided recommendations for&nbsp;establishing the future NEB Academy, Thematic Working Groups (now Digital Focus Groups), and the&nbsp;Regional Innovation Model Handbook. The NEB Academy was a key theme at NEB@CERN, where&nbsp;dedicated sessions brought together key stakeholders to explore interdisciplinary approaches to&nbsp;education, sustainability, and digital integration in the construction industry. Several new collaborations&nbsp;started as a result of synergies between the NEB and digital communities.</p>\n<p>Following this early milestone, three notable channels for onboarding stakeholders were identified: 1)&nbsp;through the NEB Academy, 2) interaction with the digital and 3) the EU regions.</p>\n<p>The NEB Academy onboarding that started at NEB@CERN laid the groundwork for further development,&nbsp;continuing in a workshop at the University of Primorska, and culminating in the formation of a new NEBA&nbsp;consortium for the Horizon Europe open call. Subsequent developments included a workshop led by&nbsp;InnovaWood and EAAE, hosted at the InnoRenew CoE in Slovenia. The collaboration engaged key digiNEB&nbsp;partners, integrating expertise from wood research, architectural education, and digital tools, culminating&nbsp;in the establishment of the NEBA CSA project. NEB Concepts, a series of 59 modular podcast episodes&nbsp;featuring key members of the NEB community and early adopters, are a contribution to NEB Academy&nbsp;pedagogical resources from the digiNEB project.</p>\n<p>As part of the digital channel onboarding strategy in the second part of the project, the JUST Industry&nbsp;Data Week, colocated with the JUST Data Annotation project at Link.ping Science Park, successfully&nbsp;onboarded communities from EDIH and industrial domains working with digital technologies to integrate&nbsp;JUST Data practices for social good. It included keynotes and sessions on ethical data and data literacy,&nbsp;and the AI for Social Good: JUST Living Environments day dedicated to furthering the digiNEB digital&nbsp;agenda, which highlighted the potential of interdisciplinary collaboration in developing data-driven&nbsp;solutions to challenges such as urban soundscapes and sustainable living environments. The week&nbsp;featured discussions on key topics such as circularity, cognitive cities, and AI applications for social good,&nbsp;demonstrating the integration of NEB principles with cutting-edge digital technologies.</p>\n<p>The EU Regions onboarding channel includes a long list of activities and events organised by the digiNEB&nbsp;community and members of the digiNEB EAB that involved onboarding regional NEB stakeholders and&nbsp;policymakers. The full list of events is available in the Annex of D3.3. Several components of a regional&nbsp;innovation strategy have been developed following the early successes of galvanising policymakers&nbsp;around NEB implementations across the EU regions. These have included the Prototype for an&nbsp;Ecosystemic Handbook and The Regional Innovation Model for ecosystemic approaches to regional&nbsp;innovation, outlined in the RIM Handbook, which leverages best practices from the NEB activities to align&nbsp;localised actions with broader regional and national strategies. These efforts aim to create ecosystems&nbsp;that address pressing environmental and social challenges and empower local communities to actively&nbsp;participate in co-creation processes.</p>\n<p>The online strategy for early adoption has been revised to focus more on substantial and enduring video&nbsp;content rather than relying on the more ephemeral nature of social media posts. This has resulted in a&nbsp;significant increase in genuine engagement within the community. Presentations, keynotes and highlights&nbsp;from events such as NEB@CERN and the JUST Industry Data Week have provided a vehicle for engagement&nbsp;and adoption, knowledge transfer, and education. A total of 83 videos have been produced (KPI: 24),&nbsp;garnering over 1600 views to date (KPI: 1000), while rising numbers will be updated in D5.4. There have&nbsp;been 223 social media posts featuring Early Adopters&rsquo; content (KPI: 192), and 11 online marketing&nbsp;campaigns (KPI: 6).</p>\n<p>The results from these onboarding activities provide a strong foundation for the upcoming final event&nbsp;and launch of the RIM Handbook at Architecture House in Brussels, where further dissemination and&nbsp;alignment of efforts through the network of project champions will maximise the impact of digiNEB across&nbsp;Europe.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The digiNEB.eu project successfully created a platform for transferring innovation best practices in&nbsp;support of the New European Bauhaus (NEB) initiative. Over its duration, the project showed that&nbsp;digital technologies can support the transition towards sustainable, inclusive, and aesthetically&nbsp;enriched living spaces, aligning with the European Green Deal's ambitions. Through a combination of&nbsp;mapping, stakeholder engagement, capacity-building, and knowledge dissemination, digiNEB.eu has&nbsp;delivered concrete results that have an impact across Europe. The key achievements of digiNEB are:</p>\n<p><strong>Mapping and Showcasing Digital Solutions and Projects</strong></p>\n<p>digiNEB.eu successfully mapped NEB-related projects and curated a Digital Toolkit comprising&nbsp;innovative digital solutions aligning with the NEB values. These tools and services provide stakeholders&nbsp;with practical, accessible resources to address NEB challenges. By combining innovations in the built&nbsp;environment into a comprehensive online toolkit of tools, projects and actors, digiNEB.eu connected&nbsp;research outcomes and real-world applications, empowering users to implement solutions that&nbsp;enhance sustainability, inclusivity, and aesthetic quality in European living environments.</p>\n<p><strong>Building a Pan-European Network</strong></p>\n<p>The project cultivated a vibrant, cross-disciplinary community of stakeholders, representing a diverse&nbsp;array of actors, including architects, designers, SMEs, policymakers, and civil society organisations.</p>\n<p>This network has been instrumental in promoting the best practices identified by the project. Through&nbsp;the Technical Working Groups (TWGs) and the External Advisory Group (EAG), digiNEB.eu fostered&nbsp;meaningful collaboration and knowledge-sharing across sectors and guided the development of&nbsp;strategies for transferring innovative solutions to diverse contexts.</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity Building and Knowledge Transfer</strong></p>\n<p>digiNEB.eu successfully conducted 16 multi-stakeholder workshops and 6 webinars, bringing together&nbsp;professionals, innovators, educators and policy actors to exchange knowledge and explore best&nbsp;practices. These events facilitated learning, networking and the transfer of innovation across the NEB&nbsp;community. To facilitate knowledge transfer, digiNEB-eu set up an e-learning catalogue of online&nbsp;courses aligning with the NEB values. digiNEB cooperates with the development of an eLearning&nbsp;platform feeding the NEBA project facilitating the platform&rsquo;s long-term sustainability. In this way,&nbsp;digiNEB leverages the knowledge of the digital ecosystem, the pan-European network and knowledge&nbsp;building towards creating a platform for capacity building.</p>\n<p><strong>Showcasing Best Practices</strong></p>\n<p>The project culminated in the open-access publication of Deliverable 3.3, a comprehensive resource&nbsp;that captures the transfer of innovation best practices throughout the project. This publication&nbsp;showcases the activities performed to strengthen the pan-European capacity building connecting&nbsp;regions, communities and actors through a multi-layered multi-stakeholder approach. These activities&nbsp;focused on collectively sharing innovations applied to real-world NEB challenges, offering replicable&nbsp;solutions for stakeholders across Europe. Events featured in the publication highlight concrete&nbsp;examples of innovative projects, tools and actors that have shown best practices in line with the NEB&nbsp;values.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>The digiNEB.eu project has delivered significant and lasting contributions in transferring innovation&nbsp;best practices across Europe. By fostering a multi-layered, multi-stakeholder collaborative and crossdisciplinary&nbsp;network and providing access to tools, projects and actors that are successfully paving the&nbsp;way, digiNEB.eu has empowered stakeholders to actively engage with the NEB community. The&nbsp;project's outputs, from the Digital Toolkit, the online platform or the policy recommendations, ensure&nbsp;that digital innovation will continue to drive the transformation of European living spaces, making&nbsp;them more sustainable, inclusive, and beautiful for generations to come.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The digiNEB.eu project supports the New European Bauhaus initiative (NEB) by creating synergies&nbsp;with EU technological innovation, particularly technologies that support Smart Communities and the&nbsp;implementation of the Green Deal. This document outlines the Early Adopters Network for national&nbsp;and regional adoption of the digiNEB.eu project. It defines Early Adopters as stakeholders who have&nbsp;actively and positively engaged with digital strategies for NEB projects, Smart Communities, or&nbsp;NEB-aligned initiatives. They are distinct from \"users\" in that they are likely to encourage and&nbsp;promote the use of these strategies among colleagues and peers, as well as provide feedback and&nbsp;contribute expert knowledge that may lead to improvements in the systems implemented.</p>\n<p>The first strategy for stakeholder engagement aims to onboard key community leaders from target&nbsp;NEB and Smart Communities projects via in-person engagement. This strategy has already been&nbsp;implemented by first identifying gaps and synergies in NEB and Smart Communities engagement, and&nbsp;then by addressing them with the first in-person Early Adopter onboarding event NEB@CERN. The&nbsp;event was conceived as a high-level co-creation lab focusing on digitally-enabled approaches to&nbsp;sustainability, inclusion and aesthetics and combined inspirational talks with &lsquo;think and do tanks&rsquo; &ndash;&nbsp;co-creation sessions focusing on digiNEB priority topics. These included the new NEB Academy for a&nbsp;sustainable built environment, and synergies between NEB and digital with multidisciplinary Smart&nbsp;Communities. The NEB@CERN event resulted in multiple achievements and impacts. It created a&nbsp;new hybrid community between the digital Smart Communities projects and NEB, resulting in the&nbsp;creation of the digiNEB Early Adopter Network. The network has started to collaborate on a White&nbsp;Paper covering topics such as mission-oriented learning, closed-loop materials lifecycles, and design&nbsp;for regional ecosystems framework conditions. The community has agreed that the NEB Lighthouses&nbsp;will now host the community on a regular basis. Thematic Working Groups have been established to&nbsp;organise the collaborative White Paper, and further activities are planned as part of the TWG&nbsp;onboarding strategy.</p>\n<p>The second strategy is to develop further the Early Adopters Network by focusing in greater detail on&nbsp;common missions through Thematic Working Groups (TWGs), contributions to the digiNEB White&nbsp;Paper and the development of TWG-related thematic events. The digiNEB.eu project has agreed to&nbsp;replace \"Technical Working Groups\" with \"Thematic Working Groups\" to encourage broader&nbsp;participation by the NEB stakeholders. Thematic Working Groups have been established through&nbsp;co-creation by the digiNEB.eu community at the NEB@CERN event and updated with the latest NEB&nbsp;agenda for the NEB Academy. Onboarding of further TWG members will be done through curated&nbsp;matchmaking between leading NEB contributors and digital innovation project owners.</p>\n<p>The third Early Adopter engagement strategy focuses on the onboarding of NEB stakeholders from&nbsp;the European Regions by means of a Regional Innovation Model. The strategy leverages background&nbsp;work completed as part of NEB High Level Round Table activities during 2022 together with the&nbsp;European Committee of the Regions, in a collaboration with Commissioner Ferreira's Cohesion Funds&nbsp;and INTERREG Europe, as well as best practice from pioneering and early successes of NEB regional&nbsp;initiatives. The adopted joint proposal by Michela Magas and the European Committee of the&nbsp;Regions focuses on a Regional Innovation Model that implements an ecosystemic approach to EU&nbsp;funds by connecting existing funding mechanisms, such as Interreg Europe and Cohesion Funds, to&nbsp;create a large-scale value network and multiplier effect for local and regional sustainability&nbsp;innovation activities. In digiNEb this proposal is being combined with best practice from successful&nbsp;NEB initiatives such as Sweden&rsquo;s National NEB project &ldquo;Visions in the North&rdquo; and the related digiNEB&nbsp;Early Adopter Duved project. Best practice content for the Regional Innovation Model combines tools&nbsp;and methods for community innovation that will be disseminated to regional Early Adopters. The</p>\n<p>Regional Innovation Model Handbook is being drafted as a guide for implementing best practices&nbsp;across various regional ecosystems. The combined Regional Innovation Model implementing&nbsp;innovative processes on the ground and scaling resulting innovations from the ground up via linked&nbsp;funding mechanisms, is expected to create wide-reaching impacts on regional ecosystems, including&nbsp;pilot solutions for circular models, environments that stimulate co-creation, behavioural shifts and&nbsp;system change. A first working draft of the RIM Handbook is included as this report&rsquo;s Annexe.</p>\n<p>The fourth strategy for Early Adopter engagement focuses on onboarding through social media,&nbsp;webinars and success stories. The strategy involves cross-promotion and content sharing between&nbsp;the website and social media channels, audience engagement through interactive activities, and a&nbsp;specific campaign dedicated for building an Early Adopter Network. The implementation of this&nbsp;strategy involves the creation of an Early Adopter application form, dedicated web pages for&nbsp;onboarded Early Adopters, events with Early Adopters, and a pay-per-click campaign. The success of&nbsp;the strategy relies on the creation of meaningful content and entry points for the early adopters on&nbsp;the digiNEB.eu platform.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In order to map the digitalisation trends across the NEB sector, to identify gaps, and put forward policy&nbsp;recommendations, five digital focus groups were organised, bringing in expert views from across the&nbsp;NEB landscape in a cross-sectional and multi-country approach. The qualitative input collection was&nbsp;preceded by desk research, which was also used in a continuous loop approach for refining, analysing,&nbsp;and interpreting results. Based on information saturation, key trends and common challenges were&nbsp;identified, presenting a comprehensive and up-to-date picture of the New European Bauhaus&nbsp;digitalisation status.</p>\n<p>Digitalisation is driven by both push and pull factors, including the optimisation of processes and&nbsp;results (pull factors) and legislative requirements (push factors). Levels of digitalisation are high within&nbsp;the professional sector. There appears to be a correlation between the size of the organisation and&nbsp;the sector, and the maturity of the digitalisation profile. In the case of client- or citizen-facing&nbsp;processes and activities, the choice of digital solutions is influenced by the literacy level of the&nbsp;population, with age being correlated with levels of digital literacy.</p>\n<p>Digitalisation should be a conscious choice and not a top-down imposition, as experienced by some&nbsp;participants. Analogue alternatives should be available for those unable or unwilling to adopt certain&nbsp;digital solutions. The myriad of alternative digital solutions leads to a time-consuming activity of&nbsp;selecting the suitable one. An interactive instrument allowing for comparison and facilitating choice&nbsp;between alternative digital solutions is highly needed. Non-intrusive digital solutions that can be&nbsp;seamlessly integrated or deployed for mapping the natural, traditional landscape are also needed.</p>\n<p>There is a hype around AI, which is perceived as having negative consequences for other high-priority&nbsp;topics. AI is changing the workplace and requires adequate training to avoid its pitfalls. It is not low AI&nbsp;literacy that is most risky, but rather overconfidence in AI systems or overestimation of one&rsquo;s AI&nbsp;literacy and skills, leading to uncritical use of AI-provided output. This is particularly risky in the&nbsp;educational sector, where the embedding of AI applications changes the learning process and risks&nbsp;eliminating formative learning experiences. The educational sector is diverse regarding the integration&nbsp;of digital instruments, with academics expressing the view that digital poverty during the academic&nbsp;experience carries over into professional life. The speed of technological development also puts&nbsp;pressure on trainers who need to acquire new skills quickly. The development of digital skills needs to&nbsp;be embedded in a contextualised learning experience and should not be an objective in itself.</p>\n<p>The adoption of bio-based materials is influenced by cost, perception, traditions, and the lack of&nbsp;standards and the possibility to insure constructions made from these materials. There is a perceived&nbsp;lack of education and training materials regarding the use of bio-based materials.</p>\n<p>A high volume of small-scale NEB initiatives leads to fragmentation and low visibility of the NEB&nbsp;programme among the wider population, missing out on the assumed capitalisation of broad&nbsp;community involvement. Digitalisation is seen as an enabler for the Green Deal. Although wider&nbsp;geopolitical factors are acknowledged as having an impact on the Green Deal and digitalisation&nbsp;targets, they are not perceived as a main influencing factor, indicating that they are rather a focus&nbsp;for policy-level agendas.</p>",
