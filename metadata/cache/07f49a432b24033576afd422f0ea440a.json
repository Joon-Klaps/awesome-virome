This report describes new research methods to study the biological significance of IAV spherical and filamentous morphologies <i>in vitro</i>and <i>in vivo</i>. Using reverse genetics, the authors created IAV WSN/33(H1N1) reporter viruses encoding mScarlet, with M1 genes that support either spherical or filamentous morphology, to enable direct comparisons of the biological effects of different virus morphologies on otherwise identical backgrounds. Using a variety of assays, they demonstrate that spherical virions enter cells and spread faster than filamentous virions. By contrast, filamentous virions, bearing more hemagglutinin copies per virion, were better able to evade neutralizing antibodies. These studies provide a starting point for further investigation using this approach.</p><p>OVERALL ASSESSMENT: This report describes functional differences between spherical and filamentous IAV morphologies in controlled settings, building upon previous studies. The central claims of the manuscript are generally well supported by the data. We identified some areas where quantitative analyses and data presentation can be strengthened.</p><p>STRENGTHS:\u00a0The manuscript is generally well written. Discrete control of virion morphology through M1 mutagenesis was viewed as a strength, and these tools will undoubtedly be used by others to advance the field. For the most part, advanced microscopy methods yielded informative, high-quality data. Phenotypes were confirmed in multiple cell lines, demonstrating a certain extent of generalizability in the findings.</p><p>WEAKNESSES:\u00a0The mScarlet reporter gene was lost from a significant proportion of viruses, as evidenced by plaque analysis, and mScarlet-deficient plaques were larger than mScarlet expressing plaques. The authors acknowledged this shortcoming but persisted in using these reporter viruses for the study, instead of further reporter gene optimization. As there were several assays that did not rely on the fluorescent reporter, reverting to reporter gene-deficient parental viruses could have been an alternative approach to power most of the study. Statements about numbers of viral particles in endosomes in Figure 3 would have been better supported by quantitative data rather than representative images. While it is interesting to observe filamentous viral particles in one endosome, this single observation does not provide sufficient insight to draw conclusions about the fate of filamentous virions in endosomes. The authors should clearly indicate the basis for estimates of number of HA proteins per virion, which are based on virion size rather than any direct measurements; we discussed the potential for flow virometry approaches for single virion analysis of HA levels. Some figures lacked statistical analysis, and overall, statistical methods could have been better described throughout.</p><p>DETAILED U.P. ASSESSMENT:\u00a0</p><p>OBJECTIVE CRITERIA (QUALITY)\u00a0</p><p>1.\u00a0\u00a0 Quality: Experiments \u00a0</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Figure by figure, do experiments, as performed, have the proper controls?</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Overall, these experiments appear to be properly controlled.</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Are specific analyses performed using methods that are consistent with answering the specific question?\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is unclear on why specific cell lines were used for specific experiments (e.g. A549 cells in Figure 3 and MDCK cells elsewhere). Rationale for cell line choice should be provided.</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The use of the fluorescent reporter virus, which was unstable and had a plaque formation defect relative to WT parental virus, was not properly justified. Further assay development and refinement could have mitigated these drawbacks for reporter viruses, or they could have been dispensed with entirely, as several assays did not require a reporter gene.\u00a0</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is there appropriate technical expertise in the collection and analysis of data presented?</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do analyses use the best-possible (most unambiguous) available methods quantified via appropriate statistical comparisons?\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0 There were a number of instances where quantitative methods were not performed, which undermined the authors' conclusions.</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0 Flow virometry could provide a beneficial alternative approach to study HA content and particle morphology. Here are some relevant studies that demonstrate this approach:</p><p><a href=\"https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cpz1.368\">https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cpz1.368</a></p><p><a href=\"https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/jvi.01765-17\">https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/jvi.01765-17</a></p><p><a href=\"https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/jvi.01717-24\">https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/jvi.01717-24</a></p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Are controls or experimental foundations consistent with established findings in the field? A review that raises concerns regarding inconsistency with widely reproduced observations should list at least two examples in the literature of such results. Addressing this question may occasionally require a supplemental figure that, for example, re-graphs multi-axis data from the primary figure using established axes or gating strategies to demonstrate how results in this paper line up with established understandings. It should not be necessary to defend exactly why these may be different from established truths, although doing so may increase the impact of the study and discussion of discrepancies is an important aspect of scholarship.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Citation of one source to justify inference of HA content based on virion size in Figure 5. This approach could be better supported.</p><p>2.\u00a0\u00a0 Quality: Completeness \u00a0</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Does the collection of experiments and associated analysis of data support the proposed title- and abstract-level conclusions? Typically, the major (title- or abstract-level) conclusions are expected to be supported by at least two experimental systems.\u00a0</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the abstract, the authors state that they show \"cellular junction integrity... do[es] not exert morphology-dependent inhibition of IAV cell-to-cell spread\" \u2013 this would be in reference to Fig 4 B-C where they show that knocking out catenin doesn't change the performance of the filamentous virions relative to the spherical. Is this really a measure of the importance of cellular junction integrity, or is it showing that even when cells are growing farther apart/at a lower density, the spherical virions are still better?</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Are there experiments or analyses that have not been performed but if ''true'' would disprove the conclusion (sometimes considered a fatal flaw in the study)? In some cases, a reviewer may propose an alternative conclusion and abstract that is clearly defensible with the experiments as presented, and one solution to ''completeness'' here should always be to temper an abstract or remove a conclusion and to discuss this alternative in the discussion section.\u00a0</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0 N/A.</p><p>3. Quality: Reproducibility \u00a0</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Figure by figure, were experiments repeated per a standard of 3 repeats or 5 mice per cohort, etc.?</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The observation of single endosome with filamentous particles in it (Fig. 3G) clearly does not adhere to these principles of quantitative analysis. The reader should be made aware that this was a single event and cannot be broadly interpreted as a generalizable phenotype without further validation.</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Are methods for experimentation and analysis adequately outlined to permit reproducibility?\u00a0</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If a ''discovery' dataset is used, has a ''validation' cohort been assessed and/or has the issue of false discovery been addressed?\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 N/A</p><p>4. Quality: Scholarship \u00a0</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Has the author cited and discussed the merits of the relevant data that would argue against their conclusion?\u00a0</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this system, a slightly higher concentration of stalk-binding antibody was required to inhibit filamentous viruses compared to spherical viruses, supporting the idea that the elevated levels of HA on filamentous viruses confers an advantage. However, the plaque size phenotype persists in the presence of anti-HA antibodies, whereby the spherical viruses make much larger plaques. Given these findings, a more nuanced discussion of the effects of anti-HA antibodies on the two viruses would be beneficial. Would polyclonal anti-HA antibodies in vivo have a different effect?</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Has the author cited and/or discussed the important works that are consistent with their conclusion and that a reader should be especially familiar when considering the work?\u00a0</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We were unable to locate the citation for the previous study that demonstrated that filamentous virions contain more HA than spherical; this is important to justify the HA quantity estimation based on surface area in Figure 5A.</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Specific (helpful) comments on grammar, diction, paper structure, or data presentation (e.g., change a graph style or color scheme) go in this section.</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Overall, the Results section would benefit from greater exposition and the strategic use of summaries to emphasize take-home messages.</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We identified several aspects of scholarship for potential improvement, figure-by-figure:</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <b>Fig. 1:</b></p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1C: When referring to this figure in the Results text, the authors refer to five point mutations in M1; these are more properly described as amino acid substitutions, as there are certain to be many synonymous mutations throughout. \u00a0</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1D/E: These representative images should have text indicating which virus is used. They are logically placed below cartoons, but since they are separate panels, the reader needs a little more guidance.</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1D/E/G: Scale bars are present, but no values are shown, and reader must refer to figure legend. Clear scale bar values on the figure are better for the reader.</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1F: This data could be more effectively presented, as the current plot of virion diameter vs. length obscures the magnitude of differences. A histogram or kernel density estimation plot to visualize the length distributions would be more appropriate. In the text they discuss the mean length for the reporter viruses, but it would be helpful to show variance and maybe a t-test.</p><p><b>Fig. 2. </b>Statement in text \"Uninfected cells showed numerous filopodia which have a wider and more variable diameter (69 \u00b1 52 nm, n=10) than filamentous viruses\" is not well supported by data. Quantitative methods should be clearly described.</p><p><b>Fig. 3. </b>This data would benefit from more quantitative analysis, i.e. number of virions/endosome. This approach will reinforce details like the extremely rare observation of filamentous virions (in one endosome). Also, observation of filamentous virions in one endosome seems to be a rare event considering 50% of cells were infected. Detailed analysis of 3D segmentations in Figs 3I-L should be more clearly described in the text to help the reader understand significance. In Fig. 3B, even though there are few biological replicates, variance should be reported. An appropriate statistical test would support the conclusion that spherical viruses infected more cells than filamentous viruses.</p><p><b>Fig 4.</b></p><p>Fig. 4A. Including an actual picture of the cells here could be helpful in addition to the cartoon, to give the reader a true sense of the cell density. This is particularly important because the quantitative density analysis reveals a large spread of data. \u00a0</p><p>Fig 4F. It is unclear from figure and legend if these are mean radial profiles but from method and text discussing this figure leads to believe that these points are means, if so, there should also be a measure of variance included in the figure.</p><p>Fig. 4H is not currently mentioned in the Results text; the figure label should be \"focus formation\" not \"plaque formation\". \u00a0</p><p><b>Fig 5.</b> If authors are assuming that the filamentous virions have more HAs based on their size, then they should also maybe assume that there are more NAs. If there are more NAs, then this would have been relevant to mention in the section about the mucin experiments. \u00a0</p><p>MORE SUBJECTIVE CRITERIA (IMPACT):\u00a0</p><p>Impact: Novelty/Fundamental and Broad Interest \u00a0</p><p>How big of an advance would you consider the findings to be if fully supported but not extended? Has an initial result (e.g., of a paradigm in a cell line) been extended to be shown (or implicated) to be important in a bigger scheme (e.g., in animals or in a human cohort)?\u00a0The extent to which this is necessary for a result to be considered of value is important. It should be explicitly discussed by a reviewer why it would be required. What work (scope and expected time) and/or discussion would improve this score, and what would this improvement add to the conclusions of the study? Care should be taken to avoid casually suggesting experiments of great cost (e.g., ''repeat a mouse-based experiment in humans'') and difficulty that merely confirm but do not extend (see Bad Behaviors, Box 2)</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We appreciated this approach to addressing knowledge gaps about the functional differences between spherical and filamentous virions. The authors position this study in context of the field, where in some cases, similar observations have been made in different systems (i.e. filamentous virions are better at escaping neutralization). This undermines the novelty of this study somewhat. Broadening this study to include an <i>in vivo</i> infection model (e.g. mice) would further extend these studies.</p>\n\n    <h2>Competing interests</h2>\n\n    <p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p>",

        "description": "<p><strong>Background:&nbsp;</strong>Many biological properties of phages are determined by phage virion proteins (PVPs), and the poor annotation of PVPs is a bottleneck for many areas of viral research, such as viral phylogenetic analysis, viral host identification, and antibacterial drug design. Because of the high diversity of PVP sequences, the PVP annotation of a phage genome remains a particularly challenging bioinformatic task.</p>\n<p><strong>Findings:&nbsp;</strong>Based on deep learning, we developed DeePVP. The main module of DeePVP aims to discriminate PVPs from non-PVPs within a phage genome, while the extended module of DeePVP can further classify predicted PVPs into the 10 major classes of PVPs. Compared with the present state-of-the-art tools, the main module of DeePVP performs better, with a 9.05% higher F1-score in the PVP identification task. Moreover, the overall accuracy of the extended module of DeePVP in the PVP classification task is approximately 3.72% higher than that of PhANNs. Two application cases show that the predictions of DeePVP are more reliable and can better reveal the compact PVP-enriched region than the current state-of-the-art tools. Particularly, in the Escherichia phage phiEC1 genome, a novel PVP-enriched region that is conserved in many other Escherichia phage genomes was identified, indicating that DeePVP will be a useful tool for the analysis of phage genomic structures.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusions:&nbsp;</strong>DeePVP outperforms state-of-the-art tools. The program is optimized in both a virtual machine with graphical user interface and a docker so that the tool can be easily run by noncomputer professionals. DeePVP is freely available at https://github.com/fangzcbio/DeePVP/.</p>",

        "description": "(Uploaded by Plazi for the Bat Literature Project) The family Rhabdoviridae comprises viruses with negative-sense (-) RNA genomes of 10-16 kb. Virions are typically enveloped with bullet-shaped or bacilliform morphology but can also be non-enveloped filaments. Rhabdoviruses infect plants or animals, including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians or fish, as well as arthropods, which serve as single hosts or act as biological vectors for transmission to animals or plants. Rhabdoviruses include important pathogens of humans, livestock, fish or agricultural crops. This is a summary of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) Report on the family Rhabdoviridae, which is available at ictv.global/report/rhabdoviridae.",

        "description": "(Uploaded by Plazi for the Bat Literature Project) Nipah and Hendra viruses belong to the novel Henipavirus genus of the Paramyxoviridae family. Its zoonotic circulation in bats and recent emergence in Malaysia with fatal consequences for humans that were in close contact with infected pigs, has made the reinforcement of epidemiological and clinical surveillance systems a priority. In this study, TaqManTM RT-PCR of the Nipah nucleoprotein has been developed so that Nipah virus RNA in field specimens or laboratory material can be characterized rapidly and specifically and quantitated. The linearity of the standard curve allowed quantification of 103 to 109 RNA transcripts. The sensitivity of the test was close to 1 pfu. The kinetics of Nipah virus production in Vero cells was monitored by the determination of infectious virus particles in the supernatant fluid and by quantitation of the viral RNA. Approximately, 1000 RNA molecules were detected per virion, suggesting the presence of many non-infectious particles, similar to other RNA viruses. TaqManTM real-time RT-PCR failed to detect Hendra virus DNA. Importantly, the method was able to detect virus despite a similar ratio in viremic sera from hamsters infected with Nipah virus. This standardized technique is sensitive and reliable and allows rapid detection and quantitation of Nipah RNA in both field and experimental materials used for the surveillance and specific diagnosis of Nipah virus.",

        "description": "(Uploaded by Plazi for the Bat Literature Project) Whole-genome sequences of two novel SARS-CoV-related bat coronaviruses, in addition to a live isolate of a bat SARS-like coronavirus, are reported; the live isolate can infect human cells using ACE2, providing the strongest evidence to date that Chinese horseshoe bats are natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV., Peter Daszak and colleagues identify two novel coronaviruses from Chinese horseshoe bats that are closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the cause of a pandemic during 2002 and 2003., They also isolate a live virus from these bats that has high sequence identity to SARS-CoV and that can infect human cells using ACE2, the same receptor that is used by SARS-CoV. The results provide the strongest evidence to date that horseshoe bats are natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV., The 2002\u20133 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was one of the most significant public health events in recent history. An ongoing outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus suggests that this group of viruses remains a key threat and that their distribution is wider than previously recognized. Although bats have been suggested to be the natural reservoirs of both viruses,,, attempts to isolate the progenitor virus of SARS-CoV from bats have been unsuccessful. Diverse SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) have now been reported from bats in China, Europe and Africa,,,, but none is considered a direct progenitor of SARS-CoV because of their phylogenetic disparity from this virus and the inability of their spike proteins to use the SARS-CoV cellular receptor molecule, the human angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2),. Here we report whole-genome sequences of two novel bat coronaviruses from Chinese horseshoe bats (family: Rhinolophidae) in Yunnan, China: RsSHC014 and Rs3367. These viruses are far more closely related to SARS-CoV than any previously identified bat coronaviruses, particularly in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein. Most importantly, we report the first recorded isolation of a live SL-CoV (bat SL-CoV-WIV1) from bat faecal samples in Vero E6 cells, which has typical coronavirus morphology, 99.9% sequence identity to Rs3367 and uses ACE2 from humans, civets and Chinese horseshoe bats for cell entry. Preliminary in vitro testing indicates that WIV1 also has a broad species tropism. Our results provide the strongest evidence to date that Chinese horseshoe bats are natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV, and that intermediate hosts may not be necessary for direct human infection by some bat SL-CoVs. They also highlight the importance of pathogen-discovery programs targeting high-risk wildlife groups in emerging disease hotspots as a strategy for pandemic preparedness.",

        "description": "<p>The Oropouche virus (OROV) is a member of the family&nbsp;<span>Peribunyaviridae</span>&nbsp;(order&nbsp;<span>Bunyavirales</span>) and the cause of a dengue-like febrile illness transmitted mainly by biting midges and mosquitoes. In this study, we aimed to explore acylphloroglucinols and xanthohumol from hops (<span>Humulus lupulus</span>&nbsp;L.) as a promising alternative for antiviral therapies. The evaluation of the inhibitory potential of hops compounds on the viral cycle of OROV was performed through two complementary approaches. The first approach applies cell-based assay post-inoculation experiments to explore the inhibitory potential on the latest steps of the viral cycle, such as genome translation, replication, virion assembly, and virion release from the cells. The second part covers in silico methods evaluating the ability of those compounds to inhibit the activity of the endonuclease domain, which is essential for transcription, binding, and cleaving RNA. In conclusion, the beta acids showed strongest inhibitory potential in post-treatment assay (EC<sub>50</sub> = 26.7 &micro;g/mL). Xanthohumol had the highest affinity for OROV endonuclease followed by colupulone and cohumulone. This result contrasts with that observed for docking and MM/PBSA analysis, where cohumulone was found to have a higher affinity. Finally, among the three tested ligands, Lys92 and Arg33 exhibited the highest affinity with the protein.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Human adenovirus 5 (HAdV-5) is used as a vector in gene therapy clinical trials, hence its interactions with the host immune system have been widely studied. Previous studies have demonstrated that HAdV-5 binds specifically to murine coagulation factor X (mFX), inhibiting IgM and complement-mediated neutralization. Here, we examined the physical binding of immune components to HAdV-5 by nanoparticle tracking analysis, neutralization assays, mass spectrometry analysis and in vivo experiments. We observed that purified mouse Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies bound to HAdV-5 only in the presence of complement components. Active serum components were demonstrated to bind to HAdV-5 in the presence or absence of mFX, indicating that immune molecules and mFX might bind to different sites. Since binding of mFX to HAdV-5 blocks the neutralization cascade, these findings suggested that not all complement-binding sites may be involved in virion neutralization. Furthermore, the data obtained from serum neutralization experiments suggested that immune molecules other than IgM and IgG may trigger activation of the complement cascade in vitro. In vivo experiments were conducted in immunocompetent C57BL/6 or immuno-deficient&nbsp;<em>Rag2<sup>-/-</sup></em> mice. HAdV-5T* (a mutant HAdV-5 unable to bind to human or mFX) was neutralized to some extent in both mouse models, suggesting that murine immunoglobulins were not required for neutralization of HAdV-5 in vivo. Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of HAdV-5 and HAdV-5T* after exposure to murine sera showed stable binding of C3 and C4b in the absence of mFX. In summary, these results suggest that HAdV-5 neutralization can be mediated by both the classical and alternative pathways and that, in the absence of immunoglobulins, the complement cascade can be activated by direct binding of C3 to the virion.</p>",

A major conclusion of these studies was that re-coding the <i>kaposin </i>RNA to reduce its GC-rich and repetitive nature without changing the protein products decreased viral fitness. This led them to hypothesize that <i>kaposin </i>RNA has an important role to play in supporting KSHV infection. Here, using RNA-FISH, they demonstrate that <i>kaposin </i>RNA accumulates in nuclear foci following reactivation from latency in epithelial and B lymphocyte infection models. By probing known protein markers of nuclear bodies, they demonstrate that these <i>kaposin </i>foci are nuclear speckles (NSs), rather than paraspeckles, Cajal bodies, or PML bodies. As lytic replication progresses, these <i>kaposin </i>NS foci change, becoming fewer and larger and more round, with substantially reduced levels of the <i>MALAT1 </i>ncRNA present as <i>kaposin </i>levels increase, suggesting that <i>kaposin </i>is displacing <i>MALAT1 </i>from its niche. A kaposin ectopic expression model confirmed that <i>kaposin </i>localizes to NSs and alters their character, making them larger and more numerous, and once again, <i>MALAT1 </i>was displaced. Employing a collection of <i>kaposin </i>mutant viruses and <i>kaposin </i>expression constructs, they demonstrate that kaposin proteins are dispensable for the <i>kaposin </i>NS localization phenotype, whereas the central <i>DR1 </i>repeats are essential; this is the first function ascribed to the <i>DR1 </i>repeats. Transcriptome analysis of <i>kaposin</i>-deficient virus infections demonstrated its broad role in supporting lytic viral gene expression. By contrast, <i>kaposin </i>deficiency alters latent gene expression by increasing or decreasing gene expression in a position-specific manner, suggestive of topologically associated domains (TADs) normally regulated by the CTCF chromatin insulator. However, CHIP experiments suggest that CTCF deposition remains unchanged in <i>kaposin </i>mutant virus infections. NSs have been shown to regulate local transcription and mRNA processing outcomes. <i>Kaposin </i>deficient viruses displayed alterations in host pre-mRNA splicing, with reduced usage of alternative 5'-splice sites, increased usage of alternative transcription termination sites, and increased intron retention; however, no clear consensus emerged across the mutant virus collection. Some alterations in KSHV pre-mRNA splicing were observed as well. Using a <i>de novo </i>endothelial cell infection model, they demonstrated that <i>kaposin </i>is required for efficient production of many viral mRNAs. Finally, the authors used a luciferase reporter assay to determine that <i>kaposin's </i>contribution to transcriptional output operates in <i>cis </i>and cannot boost transcription in <i>trans </i>when supplied on a separate plasmid. This finding is consistent with the positional effects of NSs in supporting transcription and post-transcriptional processing in the nucleus. \u00a0</p><p>OVERALL ASSESSMENT: This manuscript identifies a new viral ncRNA with a novel role as an architectural RNA that supports the formation of NSs and thereby provides positional control of transcription and mRNA processing, supporting viral gene expression and altering host gene expression. Generally, the central claims of the manuscript are well supported by the data, and we appreciated the high-quality data presentation and quantitation, as described below. While the reviewers appreciated this thorough investigation of <i>kaposin</i> function, the primary weakness of this manuscript was in the storytelling; the methodical approach to guiding the reader through a large dataset, toggling between main and supplementary figures and discussing each finding at length, undermined the readability of the manuscript. We recommend revising the manuscript to focus on the key novel findings and generate a leaner product to capture the reader's attention throughout.</p><p>STRENGTHS:\u00a0The major claims are well supported by an ample dataset. From the abstract: \"<i>Kaposin acts in cis as an architectural RNA to rebuild cellular nuclear speckles (NSs) to sites proximal to the viral genome to optimize viral gene expression. We show kaposin RNA is both necessary and sufficient for NS remodeling, and ablating kaposin colocalization with NSs using kaposin-deficient recombinant viruses impairs viral gene expression</i>\". The authors clearly demonstrate that <i>kaposin </i>operates in <i>cis </i>and not in <i>trans</i>. They demonstrate that it is sufficient to remodel NSs in the absence of infection, and <i>kaposin</i>-deficient viruses fail to do so, providing a rigorous proof. The absence of <i>kaposin </i>results in dysregulated latent and lytic viral gene expression and poor replication, and they demonstrate that the genome is positioned nearby these NSs, so it seems logical that <i>kaposin </i>plays a role in optimizing viral gene expression.</p><p>WEAKNESSES:\u00a0The manuscript reports on a very thorough investigation of novel RNA biology in KSHV infected cells, but the overlong text undermines readability. A leaner approach to writing that puts more emphasis on the main conclusions and their novelty would help get the message across to readers. At the same time, providing more information about nuclear speckle biology from the outset would help readers appreciate the novelty and importance of these findings. Some conclusions require additional support, including Fig. 4, where they claim increased cytoplasmic localization of <i>kaposin </i>RNA in the absence of SRRM2, but without a nuclear stain, this remains somewhat inconclusive.</p><p>DETAILED U.P. ASSESSMENT:\u00a0</p><p>OBJECTIVE CRITERIA (QUALITY)\u00a0</p><p>1.\u00a0\u00a0 Quality: Experiments \u00a0</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Figure by figure, do experiments, as performed, have the proper controls? <b>[note: we use this 'figure-by-figure' section for broader detailed critiques, rather than only focusing on controls]</b></p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <b>Fig. 1</b>: Overall, the experiments described in Figure 1 are well controlled and easily interpreted. This figure prompted a group discussion about the kinetics of KSHV lytic replication. The authors use a 48 h post-dox timepoint to monitor <i>kaposin </i>localization in epithelial cells and a 24 h post-dox timepoint in B lymphocytes, but do not provide rationale for these choices. Some additional description of the kinetics of a full KSHV lytic replication cycle in these two infection models should be sufficient to provide rationale and address this question (when do genome replication and virion release occur? Some of this information may be found in their previous <i>J. Virology</i> paper). If the authors have images from other stages of lytic replication, that would be helpful as well, but not necessary to address concerns.</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <b>Fig. 2</b>: These RNA-FISH experiments are properly controlled, and readers appreciated the clear presentation of quantitative data that accompanied representative images.</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <b>Fig. 3</b>: These experiments nicely demonstrate dose-dependent effects of <i>kaposin</i> RNA on NS characteristics, supporting the idea of NS remodeling, and once again, the quantitative data is well presented. Our only critique is that the representative images (e.g. Fig. 3A, 4000 ng <i>kaposin</i>) do not always reflect the findings of the quantitative data. Could the authors select images that more accurately reflect the median observation?</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <b>Fig. 4</b>: Figures 4A-D, describing the mapping of determinants of <i>kaposin </i>localization to NSs, are very well presented and described. No notes. By contrast, the important experiment investigating <i>kaposin </i>nuclear retention in Figs 4E-G is a little underdeveloped. We thought that the reader would benefit from seeing controls presented in the main figures without the necessity of consulting the supplement, to show the reader that the fractionation was well controlled and successful. Furthermore, the authors claim that <i>kaposin </i>accumulates in the cytoplasm in Fig. 4G is difficult to verify, as there is no nuclear stain like DAPI included in this experiment. Altogether, we think that this important experiment deserves a more exposition and demonstration of controls, and likely deserves its own standalone figure rather than being an add-on to Figs 4A-D.\u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <b>Fig. 5</b>: This figure nicely describes the findings of transcriptome studies. One of the important findings of Fig. 5A was that in the lytic cycle, <i>kaposin</i> deficiency had an impact on the expression of host mRNA processing genes. This finding could be better highlighted in the text. Figs. 5B and 5D do a good job of presenting the effects of <i>kaposin </i>deficiency on KSHV latent and lytic gene expression, respectively, providing the curious finding of positional dysregulation of gene expression. The one aspect of this figure that is a bit underdeveloped is Fig. 5C, which shows the results of CHIP experiments, and no significant effect of <i>kaposin </i>deficiency on CTCF binding at several loci. This experiment would benefit from additional controls \u2013 could CTCF function be altered by chemical or genetic interference in these experiments? This would help provide confidence in the findings and help the reader gauge how well the assay reports on CTCF biology. Overall, we thought that this experiment was not sufficient to conclusively rule out chromatin insulation in the mechanism of <i>kaposin </i>dependent alterations in latent viral gene expression.</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <b>Fig. 6: </b>For the most part, these experiments appear to be properly controlled. The readers really appreciated the high-quality data presentation in Fig. 6B, which nicely demonstrated which alterations in splicing patterns were significant across a very complex dataset. We acknowledge that the experiments performed in Figs. 6C and 6D are challenging, as it can be difficult to capture pre-cursors or intermediates for rapidly processed viral mRNAs. However, once again here, additional controls would strengthen this data. Could a pre-mRNA splicing inhibitor be used as a control to demonstrate the integrity of these experiments? \u00a0</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <b>Fig. 7: </b>This figure reports on two quite distinct experiments, which should be presented in separate figures to ensure the reader fully appreciates the remarkable findings in Figs. 7F/G. Figs. 7A-E provide ample support for the Figure Title \"<i>Kaposin</i>-mediated NS seeding alters viral transcription after primary infection\". The data is clearly presented and nicely quantitated in Figs. 7D-E. However, this figure title does not address the most important finding, found in Figs. 7F/G, that <i>kaposin </i>supports robust viral gene expression in <i>cis</i>, not in <i>trans</i>. As mentioned previously, giving Figs. 7F/G their own figure would help the reader appreciate this clever approach and important finding. With some extra space, these analyses could easily be expanded to include other <i>kaposin </i>mutant expression vectors described in this study.</p><p>Are specific analyses performed using methods that are consistent with answering the specific question?\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is there appropriate technical expertise in the collection and analysis of data presented?</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0 Yes</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do analyses use the best-possible (most unambiguous) available methods quantified via appropriate statistical comparisons?\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0 We really appreciated the use of the panel of <i>kaposin</i>-deficient viruses and expression constructs as a clever and rigorous approach to map determinants of <i>kaposin </i>function. We also appreciated the use of IF-FISH as a robust method, as well as the use of different targets to mark nuclear speckles (NEAT1, SON, SRRM2).</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0 When describing how their CellProfiler pipeline was used to quantify nuclear speckle data, the authors stated that \"<i>any cell that did not stain positive for kaposin was removed or \"masked\" from the remainder of the analysis</i>.\" This would be to exclude cells that did not respond to dox-induced lytic reactivation of KSHV. Would the result be the same if they used a different lytic cycle marker? Is it possible to have a cell that enters lytic replication that displays little or no <i>kaposin </i>staining?</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Are controls or experimental foundations consistent with established findings in the field? A review that raises concerns regarding inconsistency with widely reproduced observations should list at least two examples in the literature of such results. Addressing this question may occasionally require a supplemental figure that, for example, re-graphs multi-axis data from the primary figure using established axes or gating strategies to demonstrate how results in this paper line up with established understandings. It should not be necessary to defend exactly why these may be different from established truths, although doing so may increase the impact of the study and discussion of discrepancies is an important aspect of scholarship.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0 Controls and experimental foundations are well within norms for this field.</p><p>2.\u00a0\u00a0 Quality: Completeness \u00a0</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Does the collection of experiments and associated analysis of data support the proposed title- and abstract-level conclusions? Typically, the major (title- or abstract-level) conclusions are expected to be supported by at least two experimental systems.\u00a0</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0 The major title- and abstract-level conclusions are: (1) <i>kaposin </i>acts in <i>cis</i> to \"rebuild\" NSs (2) <i>kaposin </i>is necessary &amp; sufficient for NS remodeling (3) preventing colocalization of <i>kaposin </i>&amp; NSs has an impact on viral gene expression. We carefully considered these conclusions and agreed that the data provided good support for these conclusions. \u00a0</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Are there experiments or analyses that have not been performed but if ''true'' would disprove the conclusion (sometimes considered a fatal flaw in the study)? In some cases, a reviewer may propose an alternative conclusion and abstract that is clearly defensible with the experiments as presented, and one solution to ''completeness'' here should always be to temper an abstract or remove a conclusion and to discuss this alternative in the discussion section.\u00a0</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0 Further investigation of certain aspects of the study may change some conclusions (e.g. the relatively underdeveloped investigation of positional effects of <i>kaposin </i>on latent viral gene expression), but all major conclusions are very well supported by the data.</p><p>3. Quality: Reproducibility \u00a0</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Figure by figure, were experiments repeated per a standard of 3 repeats or 5 mice per cohort, etc.?</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0 For Figure 1, the number of replicates is not clearly shown in the Figure Legend. For Figure 3E, only 2 biological replicates were performed, so a 3<sup>rd</sup> should be completed.\u00a0</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is there sufficient raw data presented to assess the rigor of the analysis?\u00a0</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0 Yes.</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Are methods for experimentation and analysis adequately outlined to permit reproducibility?\u00a0</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0 Yes. The methods are sufficient.</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If a ''discovery' dataset is used, has a ''validation' cohort been assessed and/or has the issue of false discovery been addressed?\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0 False discovery rate was clearly indicated in the mRNA processing data in Fig. 6.</p><p>4. Quality: Scholarship \u00a0</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Has the author cited and discussed the merits of the relevant data that would argue against their conclusion?\u00a0</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 N/A. This is the first report of a ncRNA function for <i>kaposin</i>, so there are no other relevant studies to cite. This speaks to the novelty of their findings. \u00a0</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Has the author cited and/or discussed the important works that are consistent with their conclusion and that a reader should be especially familiar when considering the work?\u00a0</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We think that the reader would benefit from more relevant background information about NSs (function, composition, etc.) to provide a better foundation for understanding the significance of <i>kaposin </i>localization of these structures and subsequent remodeling.</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Specific (helpful) comments on grammar, diction, paper structure, or data presentation (e.g., change a graph style or color scheme) go in this section, but scores in this area should not be significant basis for decisions.</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The manuscript would benefit from some restructuring. The methodical approach to guiding the reader through a large dataset, toggling between main and supplementary figures and discussing each finding at length, undermined the readability of the manuscript. We recommend revising the manuscript to focus on the key novel findings and generate a leaner product to capture the reader's attention throughout. Also, as a rule of thumb, if the Results section has a paragraph that only has callouts to supplemental data, then at least some of that data should be in the main text.</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There was good agreement that the reader would benefit from more information about NSs and architectural RNAs (a new term for this audience) in the Introduction. Similarly, if there is relevant information to share about the functions of MALAT1 or SRRM2 or SON in the context of cell biology or virus infection, that would be helpful for the reader. Could MALAT1 displacement contribute to the differences in mRNA processing observed in Fig. 6? (minor: we really appreciated the small figure describing alternative mRNA processing outcomes \u2013 clear and concise).</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some unclear naming conventions, i.e. \"kaposin-recombinant\" \u2013we think it would be clearer to say something like \"<i>kaposin</i>-deficient\". Likewise, there were several words used to describe the changes in NSs: \"rebuild, seed, scaffold, remodel\". It would be wise to decide on a single term and stick with it. After some debate, we settled on 'remodel'. Minor: be consistent in italicization of <i>kaposin</i> when referring to the RNA.</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The graphical abstract might be difficult to understand for a non-expert and should be revised for further clarity. Minor: Subtly different colour combinations should be avoided.</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Could the Discussion provide some clues about the next logical steps in investigating loose threads, like the positional effect of <i>kaposin </i>on latent viral gene expression?</p><p>MORE SUBJECTIVE CRITERIA (IMPACT):\u00a0</p><p>Impact: Novelty/Fundamental and Broad Interest \u00a0</p><p>How big of an advance would you consider the findings to be if fully supported but not extended? Has an initial result (e.g., of a paradigm in a cell line) been extended to be shown (or implicated) to be important in a bigger scheme (e.g., in animals or in a human cohort)?\u00a0The extent to which this is necessary for a result to be considered of value is important. It should be explicitly discussed by a reviewer why it would be required. What work (scope and expected time) and/or discussion would improve this score, and what would this improvement add to the conclusions of the study? Care should be taken to avoid casually suggesting experiments of great cost (e.g., ''repeat a mouse-based experiment in humans'') and difficulty that merely confirm but do not extend (see Bad Behaviors, Box 2)</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This manuscript presents important novel findings about a newly discovered viral ncRNA. The authors mention that similar ncRNAs are present in other herpesvirus genomes, and extending their findings to investigate the localization of these other viral ncRNAs and their effects on NS remodeling in ectopic expression models or infection models would certainly be an attractive way to extend their findings.</p>\n\n    <h2>Competing interests</h2>\n\n    <p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Swine vesicular disease is a highly contagious disease of pigs that is caused by an enterovirus of the family Picornaviridae. The virus is a relatively recent derivative of the human coxsackievirus B5, with which it has high molecular and antigenic homology. The disease is not severe, and affected animals usually show moderate general weakening and slight weight loss that is recovered in few days, as well as vesicular lesions in the mucosa of the mouth and nose and in the interdigital spaces of the feet. However, the similarity of these lesions to those caused by foot-and-mouth disease virus has led to the inclusion of this virus in list A of the Office International des Epizooties. The disease has been eradicated in the European Union except in Italy, where it is considered endemic in the south. Nevertheless, as occasional outbreaks still appear and must be eliminated rapidly, European countries are on the alert and farms are monitored routinely for the presence of the virus. This circumstance has led to a considerable effort to study the pathology of the disease and the molecular biology and antigenicity of the virus, andto the development of optimized methods for the diagnosis of the infection.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Background: Human adenoviral (HAdV) infections are usually mild and self-limited, however, several types from species A, B, C, D and E, can cause severe illnesses that have raised public health concerns in the last years. Current available anti-viral therapies have limited efficacy and severe side effects, being an urgent need the finding of new targets for specific anti-adenoviral drug design. Our previous work has shown that the small molecule compound, HBX, inhibits HAdV-type 5 (species C) replication and oncogenic transformation through inhibition of the cellular pro-viral factor ubiquitin specific protease 7 (USP7). Methods: Here we have tested the ability of HBX to inhibit other human Adenovirus species, as well as different clinical isolates that induce severe infections, by treatment of HAdV-infected A549 cells with different HBX concentrations. We have analysed the anti-viral efficacy of this drug by determining the inhibitory concentration to the 50% (IC50) necessary to decrease both viral genome copies and virus progeny production at different time points after infection. Results: Interestingly, we have seen that, in addition to its effect on HAdV-C5, HBX is able to significantly inhibit virus genome replication and progeny release of all Adenovirus types tested, with the exception of types 12 and 31, from species A. Of note, clinical isolates were more sensitive to HBX treatment than their laboratory counterparts. Conclusions: These results point to HBX as a promising broad-spectrum anti-adenoviral drug, opening new opportunities to prevent and improve the treatment of severe adenoviral infections.</p>",
