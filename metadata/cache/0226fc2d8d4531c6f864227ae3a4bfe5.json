      "description": "A distributed information retrieval system with resource-selection and result-set merging capability was used to search subsets of the GOV2 document corpus for the 2008 TREC Million Query Track. The GOV2 collection was partitioned into host-name subcollections and distributed to multiple remote machines. The Multisearch demonstration application restricted each search to a fraction of the available sub-collections that was pre-determined by a resource-selection algorithm. Experiment results from topic-by-topic resource selection and aggregate topic resource selection are compared. The sensitivity of Multisearch retrieval performance to variations in the resource selection algorithm is discussed.",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Objective: To analyze the effect of endoscopic titanium clips combined with tissue adhesive in treating GOV2 (Type 2 Gastroesophageal Varices) patients. Methods: One-hundred-and-seventeen GOV2 patients from June 2018 to June 2020 were divided into the observation group ([Formula: see text]) and control group ([Formula: see text]). The observation group was treated with endoscopic titanium clip combined with the tissue adhesive, while controls were treated with tissue adhesive alone. The clinical effects were compared at 1, 6, and 24 months. Results: Overall response rates of the observation group at 1, 6, and 24 months were 98.31%, 96.61%, and 91.53%, respectively, vs. 81.03%, 76.27%, and 55.17% in controls ([Formula: see text]). The number, diameters, red color sign proportion of varicose veins, and incidence of bleeding in the observation group were lower than the control group, and the GQOL-74 (Generic Quality of Life Inventory 74) score was higher at 1, 6, and 24 months ([Formula: see text]). There was no significant difference in complications, mortality at 6 and 24 months, and recurrence rate at 6 months ([Formula: see text]); however, the recurrence rate at 24 months after treatment was lower in the observation group (6.78% vs. 20.69%) ([Formula: see text]). Conclusions: Endoscopic titanium clips combined with tissue adhesive can be applied to treat GOV2 patients. </jats:p>",

      "description": "A Grid Information Retrieval (GIR) simulation was used to process the TREC Million Query Track queries. The GOV2 collection was partitioned by hostname and the aggregate performance of each host, as measured by qrel counts from the past TREC Terabyte Tracks, was used to rank the hosts in order of quality. Only the 100 highest quality hosts were included in the Grid IR simulation, representing less than 20% of all GOV2 documents. The IR performance of the GIR simulation, as measured by the topic-averaged AP, b-pref, and Rel@10 over the TREC Terabyte-Track topics is within one standard deviation of the respective topic-averaged TREC Million Query participant median scores. Estimated AP of the Million Query topic results is comparable to the topic-averaged AP of the Terabyte topic results.",

      "description": "The CMU Distributed IR group's experiments for the TREC 2004 Terabyte track are some of the first to use Indri, a new indexing and retrieval component developed by the University of Massachusetts for the Lemur Toolkit [2]. Indri combines an inference network with a language-modeling approach and is designed to scale to terabyte-sized collections. Our goals for this year's Terabyte track were modest: to complete a set of simple baseline runs successfully using the new Indri software, and to gain more experience with Indri's retrieval model, the track's GOV2 corpus, and terabyte-scale collections in general.",
