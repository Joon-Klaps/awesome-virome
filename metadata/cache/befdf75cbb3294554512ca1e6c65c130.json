        "description": "<p>Agent-based modeling is indispensable for studying complex systems across many domains. However, existing simulation platforms exhibit two major issues: performance and modularity. Low performance prevents simulations with a large number of agents, increases development time, limits parameter exploration, and raises computing costs. Inflexible software designs motivate modelers to create their own tools, diverting valuable resources.</p>\n<p>This dissertation introduces a novel simulation platform called BioDynaMo and its significant improvement, TeraAgent, to alleviate these challenges via three major works.</p>\n<p>First, we lay the platform's foundation by defining abstractions, establishing software infrastructure, and implementing a multitude of features for agent-based modeling. We demonstrate BioDynaMo's modularity through use cases in neuroscience, epidemiology, and oncology. We validate these models and show the simplicity of adding new functionality with few lines of code.</p>\n<p>Second, we perform a rigorous performance analysis and identify challenges for shared-memory parallelism. Provided solutions include an optimized grid for neighbor searching, mechanisms to reduce the memory access latency, and exploiting domain knowledge to omit unnecessary work. These improvements yield up to three orders of magnitude speedups, enabling simulations of 1.7 billion agents on a single server.</p>\n<p>Third, we present TeraAgent, a distributed simulation engine that allows scaling out the computation of one simulation to multiple servers. We identify and address server communication bottlenecks and implement solutions for serialization and delta encoding to accelerate and reduce data transfer. TeraAgent can simulate 500 billion agents and scales to 84096 CPU cores.</p>\n<p><br>BioDynaMo has been widely adopted, including a prize-winning radiotherapy simulation recognized as a top 10 breakthrough in physics in 2024.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The New European Bauhaus (NEB) is a European Union initiative aimed at transforming the&nbsp;design, planning, and construction of living environments to make the green transition&nbsp;enjoyable, attractive, and accessible for all. The DigiNEB project supports this vision by&nbsp;bridging the digital and NEB communities, creating a pan-European digital ecosystem to&nbsp;promote EU digital solutions for greener, more inclusive living spaces. DigiNEB focuses on&nbsp;raising awareness, fostering collaboration, and ensuring the long-term sustainability of&nbsp;digital tools and methods within the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC)&nbsp;sector.</p>\n<p>DigiNEB outlines in this context a roadmap to ensure the long-term impact of its initiatives,&nbsp;emphasising the transfer of methods and tools to stakeholders. The roadmap aligns with the&nbsp;NEB Academy, which aims to upskill and reskill the construction ecosystem for a&nbsp;regenerative, bio-based, and circular economy.</p>\n<p><strong>Roadmap for Digital Literacy in NEB</strong></p>\n<p>The NEB Academy will serve as the central hub for collecting, supervising, and developing&nbsp;courses and training programs to support the Green Transition. To address fragmentation&nbsp;and ensure accessibility, the following steps are recommended based on the experience of&nbsp;DigiNEB:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>NEB Course Base: Establish a certified repository of courses and training options to&nbsp;unify offerings across the EU.</li>\n<li>EU Dataspace for Open Educational Resources (OER): Create a centralised&nbsp;infrastructure to share, mix, and reuse OER, integrating them into local Learning&nbsp;Management Systems.</li>\n<li>Integration of Digital and AI Literacy: Integrate digital and AI literacy into&nbsp;professional titles like \"architect,\" pushing higher education institutions to include&nbsp;these skills in their curricula.</li>\n<li>EU Micro-Credentials: Implement a standardised system for micro-credentials (3&ndash;30&nbsp;ECTS) to certify lifelong learning, ensuring recognition across EU member states.</li>\n<li>Open Badges / EuroPass: Develop a standardised system for digital badges or&nbsp;certifications to validate micro-credentials and skills acquired through lifelong&nbsp;learning.</li>\n<li>Financing Mechanism for Lifelong Learning: Establish funding mechanisms similar to&nbsp;those for traditional education to support lifelong learning initiatives.</li>\n<li>Course Localisation: Support the translation and adaptation of courses to local&nbsp;languages and regional specifications to ensure accessibility across the EU.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Timeline for Digital Literacy Roadmap:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>2020&ndash;2025: Launch the NEB Academy Alliance and pilot micro-credentials.</li>\n<li>2025&ndash;2030: Develop the NEB course base, EU dataspace for OER, and Open Badges/EuroPass system.</li>\n<li>2030&ndash;2035: Implement EU-wide micro-credentials and funding mechanisms for lifelong learning.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Roadmap for Digitalisation in NEB</strong></p>\n<p>To support the NEB&rsquo;s digital transformation, the following actions are proposed:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Cascading NEB Grants: Allocate funding to smaller NEB stakeholders through cascading grants, enabling them to participate in EU-funded projects.</li>\n<li>Open-Source Requirement: Mandate that digital tools developed through EU funding be open-source, unless restricted by knowledge security concerns.</li>\n<li>E-Learning and Citizen Platforms: Fast-track the development of open-source platforms for e-learning and citizen engagement (e.g., co-planning and local democracy tools).</li>\n<li>Digital Workflows: Focus on developing and teaching workflows how multiple tools sequentially can meet specific objectives, alongside separate tool development.</li>\n<li>Discovery Support: Enhance the dissemination of EU-funded projects by training participants in (digital) outreach and networking with local governments, NGOs, and market players.</li>\n<li>Horizon Software Space: Establish a Git repository for hosting and developing digital solutions from EU-funded projects.</li>\n<li>Interoperability: Require EU-funded projects to address the full complexity of NEB principles (beauty, sustainability, inclusion) and ensure interoperability between tools.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Timeline for Digitalisation Roadmap:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>2020&ndash;2025: Launch DigiNEB and initiate cascading grants.</li>\n<li>2025&ndash;2030: Develop open-source e-learning and citizen platforms, enforce opensource&nbsp;and interoperability requirements for EU-funded projects.</li>\n<li>2030&ndash;2035: Focus on digital workflows and establish the Horizon software space.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>DigiNEB&rsquo;s digital literacy and digitalisation roadmaps aim to create a cohesive, sustainable,&nbsp;and inclusive ecosystem for the AEC sector. By addressing gaps in funding, accessibility,&nbsp;interoperability, and digital skills, these roadmaps will support the EU&rsquo;s Green Deal and&nbsp;ensure the long-term success of the NEB initiative through the continuation in the NEB&nbsp;Academy. The integration of open education, micro-credentials, and open-source solutions&nbsp;will empower stakeholders to drive the green transition effectively.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Roadmap is a strategic action plan to maximize the impact of the digiNEB&nbsp;project. It emphasizes the need for immediate and meaningful actions,&nbsp;ensuring that the initiative evolves as planned in Year 2.&nbsp;The digiNEB platform aspires to be an open, collaborative co-creation space,&nbsp;fostering training, skills development, and learning within the NEB community&nbsp;while leveraging digital solutions. There is a noticeable cultural difference&nbsp;between the NEB community and IT or engineering communities, which needs&nbsp;to be addressed for effective integration.</p>\n<p><strong>Action 1 - WP2: Shifting Towards an Open Repository</strong></p>\n<p>This action seeks to transform the digital hub into an open, collaborative cocreation&nbsp;space, offering innovative solutions and promoting interaction among&nbsp;stakeholders. The existing catalog/toolkit approach needs to evolve into an&nbsp;open repository, allowing for content storage and joint development by the&nbsp;active community.</p>\n<p><strong>Action 2 - WP2: Aligning with NEB Community</strong></p>\n<p>digiNEB will cluster the digital initiatives within the NEB community by&nbsp;organizing workshops to broaden the scope of digital innovation. The aim is to&nbsp;engage key actors in the industry and develop a consolidated NEB community.</p>\n<p><strong>Action 3 - WP3: Transitioning to Open Courseware</strong></p>\n<p>The E-learning platform provided by digiNEB needs to transform into an open&nbsp;courseware repository to meet the needs of the NEB Academy effectively. It&nbsp;should enable the maintenance of open educational resources and courses by&nbsp;content providers.</p>\n<p><strong>Action 4 - WP3: Engaging Regional Ecosystems</strong></p>\n<p>The Roadmap aims to collaborate with the Committee of the Regions to&nbsp;establish a regional voucher scheme, involving various EU Regions in creating&nbsp;sustainable solutions using the digiNEB toolkit.</p>\n<p><strong>Action 5 - WP4: Continuous Engagement</strong></p>\n<p>digiNEB will create a community calendar for regular in-person digiNEB&nbsp;community events. These events aim to foster interaction and engagement&nbsp;among NEB community members, including NEB Fest in Spring 2024.</p>\n<p><strong>Action 6 - WP4: Onboarding the EDIH</strong></p>\n<p>Efforts will be strengthened to onboard the European Digital Innovation Hubs&nbsp;(EDIH) through a partnership with MADE, the EDIH competence center for&nbsp;Industry 4.0 at the Politecnico di Milano.</p>\n<p><strong>Action 7 - WP4: Global Interaction</strong></p>\n<p>The digiNEB project will provide a catalogue of tools for the global NEB Fest in&nbsp;2024, to support partnering with initiatives worldwide and to encourage&nbsp;participation and contribution.</p>\n<p><strong>Action 8 - WP4: Open Science and Innovation</strong></p>\n<p>To promote community co-creation of sustainable solutions, digiNEB will&nbsp;introduce Open Product Licenses, evolving them with the community in&nbsp;applied scenarios.</p>\n<p><strong>Action 9 - WP5: Social Dimension and Accountability</strong></p>\n<p>The project will introduce JUST data annotation to ensure responsible research&nbsp;and accountability while respecting privacy and security.</p>\n<p><strong>Action 10 - WP5: Building the NEB Academy</strong></p>\n<p>Responding to the NEB JRC team&rsquo;s request, digiNEB will put a focus on the NEB&nbsp;Academy, to consolidate a successful launch of the initiative and integrate&nbsp;digital tools relevant to the NEB principles.&nbsp;Along those actions, the comprehensive Roadmap offers a clear and ambitious&nbsp;plan to guide the digiNEB initiative towards achieving its goals effectively and&nbsp;making a lasting impact within the NEB community.</p>",

        "description": "<p><strong>Background</strong>: Observations of children&rsquo;s play are crucial for evaluating the use of playgrounds. Today, human-based direct observation tools such as the System for Observing Play and Leisure Activity in Youth (SOPLAY) are commonly used. These tools have limitations: they are resource-intensive, the scalability is limited, they do not allow long-term measurement, and there is a risk of human-induced bias.</p>\n<p><strong>Aim</strong>: In theory, cameras-based observations and computer vision can effectively address these challenges. However, in practice there are still many barriers. We are developing a solution resolving the quirks and obstacles we have encountered.</p>\n<p><strong>Methods and Results</strong>: Preliminary analysis is underway, utilising footage from outdoor playgrounds by a video camera processed through the YOLO computer vision model. Validation is achieved by comparing the model's automated detection of time spent and occupancy in specific areas of interest (e.g., equipment) with human-annotated ground truth data.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusions</strong>: We have successfully demonstrated our concept's feasibility and identified potential users eager to adopt our solution. However, to meet the specific needs of both our target users and the research community, further development, validation, and rigorous real-world testing are required. To accelerate this process, we are actively seeking collaborative opportunities.</p>",

This document outlines the updated engagement objectives, evolving stakeholder&nbsp;groups, engagement channels, risks, and the roles and responsibilities of DigiNEB&rsquo;s partners.</p>\n<p>The DigiNEB platform aims to deepen stakeholder understanding of the New European Bauhaus,&nbsp;keep stakeholders informed of key developments, contribute to the NEB digital transformation, and&nbsp;disseminate NEB best practices. It also fosters cross-disciplinary and cross-sectoral collaboration,&nbsp;monitors the overall impact of NEB activities, and contributes to policy development and&nbsp;standardisation.</p>\n<p>In 2023, DigiNEB played a pivotal role in rallying the NEB community around the NEB Mission,&nbsp;engaging Member States to support it during a key meeting at the Council of Europe on the 12th of&nbsp;September 2023. Following this, DigiNEB gathered eminent leaders from NEB Labs and Lighthouses&nbsp;to co-author a White Paper. This document, which was included as an annexe in deliverable D4.2,&nbsp;provides strategic direction for the NEB Mission&rsquo;s evolution and its eventual transition towards the&nbsp;NEB Facility, a future-focused funding mechanism. The White Paper captures the insights of thought&nbsp;leaders from across the NEB ecosystem and serves as a foundational guide for shaping the NEB's&nbsp;future, policy, and initiatives.</p>\n<p>This final version of the updated Stakeholder Engagement Plan moves beyond addressing the initial&nbsp;catalogue of distinct target groups - architects, designers, educators, etc. Based on insights from the&nbsp;project&rsquo;s first phase and in consultation with partners, the plan has adopted a more flexible,&nbsp;mission-driven approach. This strategy unites multidisciplinary communities around topics of shared&nbsp;interest, following successful models from NEB projects such as Bauhaus of the Seas Sails, Nordic&nbsp;Carbon-Neutral Bauhaus, and Bauhaus Goes South. Aligning DigiNEB with these core themes has&nbsp;proven effective for onboarding large stakeholder pools, encouraging cross-sectoral collaboration,&nbsp;and promoting co-creation.</p>\n<p>Since the project amendment and refocus, a major upgrade to the DigiNEB website provides a more&nbsp;intuitive and user-friendly interface, enhancing stakeholder access to valuable resources such as the&nbsp;NEB Concepts modular podcast. The revamped website now functions as a central hub for&nbsp;stakeholders, offering improved navigation, interactive learning tools, and databases that support&nbsp;co-creation activities.</p>\n<p>The DigiNEB project is actively connecting with industry partners, European Digital Innovation Hubs&nbsp;(including Link&ouml;ping Science Park), the EU Capital of Innovation (Link&ouml;ping, Sweden), and a range of&nbsp;digital projects in alignment with the objectives set out in the Description of Action (DOA). Through&nbsp;the digital technical working groups/digital focus groups, a broad spectrum of stakeholders from&nbsp;different EU member and associated states has been engaged.</p>\n<p>The NEB Concepts modular podcast was created to respond to challenges in sustaining meaningful&nbsp;engagement through traditional social media. It offers a modular approach, allowing users to explore&nbsp;themes such as sustainability, design, and innovation in a flexible format that promotes deeper&nbsp;learning and engagement. This podcast represents a shift toward more substantive, long-term&nbsp;engagement strategies, moving away from the transient nature of social media.</p>\n<p>This version of the deliverable includes a substantial new section (Section 5) that reports on the final&nbsp;event of the DigiNEB project in Brussels. &lsquo;Celebrating the Lessons Learnt&rsquo; brought together 64&nbsp;thought leaders from across the wider NEB community, including Lighthouses, Labs and other&nbsp;Coordination Actions as well as policymakers. The final event also featured dynamic discussions in a&nbsp;series of 'Think and Do Tanks' to reflect on lessons learnt and formulate concrete policy&nbsp;recommendations for the NEB roadmap. These outcomes are detailed in Section 5.13.</p>\n<p>The final event launched the published Regional Innovation Model (RIM) Handbook, based on NEB&nbsp;community activities with regional governments and using the Jan &Aring;man and Adam Davies Prototype&nbsp;for an Ecosystemic Handbook as a foundation. The RIM Handbook is designed to be a companion to&nbsp;city and regional administrators. It includes practical examples of engagement and activities for local&nbsp;actors and changemakers in collaboration across sectors and disciplines. It suggests ways to think&nbsp;about grand challenges that address specific needs and characteristics of regional ecosystems while&nbsp;it offers support instruments and frameworks to leverage local intelligence and create a systemic&nbsp;shift at the global scale.</p>\n<p>By focusing on ecosystemic approaches to regional development, the handbook ensures that the&nbsp;NEB community can benefit from proven methodologies and tools that drive innovation and&nbsp;collaboration across Europe. The handbook&rsquo;s launch was further supported by commitments from&nbsp;policymakers, including the plan for a second major launch event at the European Committee of the&nbsp;Regions yearly Plenary in April 2025. This strategic dissemination ensures the handbook&rsquo;s reach&nbsp;extends to policymakers across Europe, amplifying its utility as a cornerstone of regional NEB-aligned&nbsp;innovation.</p>\n<p>In addition to these resources, the project has undergone significant development, including&nbsp;redesigning the DigiNEB website to provide a more intuitive and accessible hub for stakeholders.&nbsp;This upgraded platform offers enhanced features such as interactive learning tools, improved&nbsp;navigation, and the integration of digital co-creation methodologies.&nbsp;Stakeholder engagement has evolved significantly, culminating in the joint event with CrAFt and&nbsp;NEBula at Architect House in Brussels and the knowledge exchange at the JUST Industry Data Week&nbsp;in Link&ouml;ping. The project&rsquo;s engagement strategy emphasises data ethics and AI for social good,&nbsp;integrating these themes into broader discussions around sustainability and digital transformation.</p>\n<p>These efforts are aligned with the project's goal of fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and&nbsp;supporting the NEB mission at the European level. This deliverable underscores the integration of&nbsp;digital and co-creation methodologies into the broader NEB mission, leveraging insights from events&nbsp;such as the JUST Industry Data Week and the final Brussels event.</p>",

This document, which is included as an annex to this&nbsp;report, provides strategic direction for the NEB Mission&rsquo;s evolution and its eventual transition&nbsp;towards the NEB Facility, a future-focused funding mechanism. The White Paper captures the&nbsp;insights of thought leaders from across the NEB ecosystem and serves as a foundational guide for&nbsp;shaping the NEB's future, policy, and initiatives.</p>\n<p>This updated Stakeholder Engagement Plan moves beyond addressing the initial catalogue of distinct&nbsp;target groups - architects, designers, educators, etc. Based on insights from the project&rsquo;s first phase&nbsp;and in consultation with partners, the plan has adopted a more flexible, mission-driven approach.

This podcast represents a shift&nbsp;toward more substantive, long-term engagement strategies, moving away from the transient nature&nbsp;of social media.</p>\n<p>The Handbook for Ecosystemic Regional Innovation further supports DigiNEB&rsquo;s mission by offering&nbsp;local and regional leaders practical guidance on how to implement NEB principles within their own&nbsp;contexts. By focusing on ecosystemic approaches to regional development, the handbook ensures that&nbsp;the NEB community can benefit from proven methodologies and tools that drive innovation and&nbsp;collaboration across Europe.</p>\n<p>In addition to these resources, the project has undergone significant development, including the&nbsp;redesign of the DigiNEB website to provide a more intuitive and accessible hub for stakeholders. This&nbsp;upgraded platform offers enhanced features such as interactive learning tools, improved navigation,&nbsp;and the integration of digital co-creation methodologies.</p>\n<p>DigiNEB established a repository after the NEB@CERN event, providing an ongoing resource for&nbsp;the NEB community. This platform, initially created to support collaboration following the event,&nbsp;has led to ongoing interaction by that community of contributors, hosted by sister projects such as&nbsp;CrAft and the NEB Academy. The community unified by this milestone event at CERN has&nbsp;maintained regular dialogue, collaboration and interaction, driving forward the collective NEB&nbsp;vision.</p>\n<p>Stakeholder engagement has evolved significantly, with new strategies focusing on collaboration,&nbsp;community participation, and co-creation. Key NEB stakeholders, including policymakers, industry&nbsp;leaders, and civil society, have been actively involved in the development of best practices for regional&nbsp;innovation. The project&rsquo;s engagement strategy now emphasises data ethics and AI for social good,&nbsp;integrating these themes into broader discussions around sustainability and digital transformation.&nbsp;These efforts are aligned with the project's goal of fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and&nbsp;supporting the NEB mission at the European level.</p>\n<p>Stakeholder engagement remains a shared responsibility of all DigiNEB consortium members.&nbsp;Leveraging existing networks and connections remains a core aspect of the project&rsquo;s outreach&nbsp;strategy. Each partner continues to focus on specific areas of engagement, ensuring that the project&nbsp;benefits from a diverse range of strengths and avoids duplication of efforts. Stakeholder engagement&nbsp;has also been conducted in parallel lines of community interaction, by participation in broad interest&nbsp;community activities of DigiNEB project partners. This collaborative approach, paired with the&nbsp;updated tools and methodologies outlined in this document, positions DigiNEB to foster&nbsp;interdisciplinary collaboration and advance the NEB&rsquo;s mission effectively.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This document outlines the Early Adopters Network for national and regional adoption of the digiNEB&nbsp;project. It defines Early Adopters as stakeholders who have actively and positively engaged with digital&nbsp;strategies in conjunction with NEB projects and NEB-aligned initiatives. A total of 134 Early Adopters have&nbsp;been successfully onboarded, exceeding the original targets (KPI: 100). These individuals have become&nbsp;champions for the project, actively contributing to the promotion of NEB principles, educational&nbsp;methodologies and digital tools compiled by the project.</p>\n<p>With the project&rsquo;s aim to join NEB and smart digital communities, the NEB@CERN 3-day event was&nbsp;achieved as an early milestone, 4 months earlier than planned, to bring together NEB and smart&nbsp;communities thought leaders and stakeholders around future directions for learning, digital and strategies&nbsp;for EU regions. As a high-level co-creation series of Think and Do Tanks, it provided recommendations for&nbsp;establishing the future NEB Academy, Thematic Working Groups (now Digital Focus Groups), and the&nbsp;Regional Innovation Model Handbook. The NEB Academy was a key theme at NEB@CERN, where&nbsp;dedicated sessions brought together key stakeholders to explore interdisciplinary approaches to&nbsp;education, sustainability, and digital integration in the construction industry. Several new collaborations&nbsp;started as a result of synergies between the NEB and digital communities.</p>\n<p>Following this early milestone, three notable channels for onboarding stakeholders were identified: 1)&nbsp;through the NEB Academy, 2) interaction with the digital and 3) the EU regions.</p>\n<p>The NEB Academy onboarding that started at NEB@CERN laid the groundwork for further development,&nbsp;continuing in a workshop at the University of Primorska, and culminating in the formation of a new NEBA&nbsp;consortium for the Horizon Europe open call. Subsequent developments included a workshop led by&nbsp;InnovaWood and EAAE, hosted at the InnoRenew CoE in Slovenia. The collaboration engaged key digiNEB&nbsp;partners, integrating expertise from wood research, architectural education, and digital tools, culminating&nbsp;in the establishment of the NEBA CSA project. NEB Concepts, a series of 59 modular podcast episodes&nbsp;featuring key members of the NEB community and early adopters, are a contribution to NEB Academy&nbsp;pedagogical resources from the digiNEB project.</p>\n<p>As part of the digital channel onboarding strategy in the second part of the project, the JUST Industry&nbsp;Data Week, colocated with the JUST Data Annotation project at Link.ping Science Park, successfully&nbsp;onboarded communities from EDIH and industrial domains working with digital technologies to integrate&nbsp;JUST Data practices for social good. It included keynotes and sessions on ethical data and data literacy,&nbsp;and the AI for Social Good: JUST Living Environments day dedicated to furthering the digiNEB digital&nbsp;agenda, which highlighted the potential of interdisciplinary collaboration in developing data-driven&nbsp;solutions to challenges such as urban soundscapes and sustainable living environments. The week&nbsp;featured discussions on key topics such as circularity, cognitive cities, and AI applications for social good,&nbsp;demonstrating the integration of NEB principles with cutting-edge digital technologies.</p>\n<p>The EU Regions onboarding channel includes a long list of activities and events organised by the digiNEB&nbsp;community and members of the digiNEB EAB that involved onboarding regional NEB stakeholders and&nbsp;policymakers. The full list of events is available in the Annex of D3.3. Several components of a regional&nbsp;innovation strategy have been developed following the early successes of galvanising policymakers&nbsp;around NEB implementations across the EU regions. These have included the Prototype for an&nbsp;Ecosystemic Handbook and The Regional Innovation Model for ecosystemic approaches to regional&nbsp;innovation, outlined in the RIM Handbook, which leverages best practices from the NEB activities to align&nbsp;localised actions with broader regional and national strategies. These efforts aim to create ecosystems&nbsp;that address pressing environmental and social challenges and empower local communities to actively&nbsp;participate in co-creation processes.</p>\n<p>The online strategy for early adoption has been revised to focus more on substantial and enduring video&nbsp;content rather than relying on the more ephemeral nature of social media posts. This has resulted in a&nbsp;significant increase in genuine engagement within the community. Presentations, keynotes and highlights&nbsp;from events such as NEB@CERN and the JUST Industry Data Week have provided a vehicle for engagement&nbsp;and adoption, knowledge transfer, and education. A total of 83 videos have been produced (KPI: 24),&nbsp;garnering over 1600 views to date (KPI: 1000), while rising numbers will be updated in D5.4. There have&nbsp;been 223 social media posts featuring Early Adopters&rsquo; content (KPI: 192), and 11 online marketing&nbsp;campaigns (KPI: 6).</p>\n<p>The results from these onboarding activities provide a strong foundation for the upcoming final event&nbsp;and launch of the RIM Handbook at Architecture House in Brussels, where further dissemination and&nbsp;alignment of efforts through the network of project champions will maximise the impact of digiNEB across&nbsp;Europe.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The digiNEB.eu project successfully created a platform for transferring innovation best practices in&nbsp;support of the New European Bauhaus (NEB) initiative. Over its duration, the project showed that&nbsp;digital technologies can support the transition towards sustainable, inclusive, and aesthetically&nbsp;enriched living spaces, aligning with the European Green Deal's ambitions. Through a combination of&nbsp;mapping, stakeholder engagement, capacity-building, and knowledge dissemination, digiNEB.eu has&nbsp;delivered concrete results that have an impact across Europe. The key achievements of digiNEB are:</p>\n<p><strong>Mapping and Showcasing Digital Solutions and Projects</strong></p>\n<p>digiNEB.eu successfully mapped NEB-related projects and curated a Digital Toolkit comprising&nbsp;innovative digital solutions aligning with the NEB values. These tools and services provide stakeholders&nbsp;with practical, accessible resources to address NEB challenges. By combining innovations in the built&nbsp;environment into a comprehensive online toolkit of tools, projects and actors, digiNEB.eu connected&nbsp;research outcomes and real-world applications, empowering users to implement solutions that&nbsp;enhance sustainability, inclusivity, and aesthetic quality in European living environments.</p>\n<p><strong>Building a Pan-European Network</strong></p>\n<p>The project cultivated a vibrant, cross-disciplinary community of stakeholders, representing a diverse&nbsp;array of actors, including architects, designers, SMEs, policymakers, and civil society organisations.</p>\n<p>This network has been instrumental in promoting the best practices identified by the project. Through&nbsp;the Technical Working Groups (TWGs) and the External Advisory Group (EAG), digiNEB.eu fostered&nbsp;meaningful collaboration and knowledge-sharing across sectors and guided the development of&nbsp;strategies for transferring innovative solutions to diverse contexts.</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity Building and Knowledge Transfer</strong></p>\n<p>digiNEB.eu successfully conducted 16 multi-stakeholder workshops and 6 webinars, bringing together&nbsp;professionals, innovators, educators and policy actors to exchange knowledge and explore best&nbsp;practices. These events facilitated learning, networking and the transfer of innovation across the NEB&nbsp;community. To facilitate knowledge transfer, digiNEB-eu set up an e-learning catalogue of online&nbsp;courses aligning with the NEB values. digiNEB cooperates with the development of an eLearning&nbsp;platform feeding the NEBA project facilitating the platform&rsquo;s long-term sustainability. In this way,&nbsp;digiNEB leverages the knowledge of the digital ecosystem, the pan-European network and knowledge&nbsp;building towards creating a platform for capacity building.</p>\n<p><strong>Showcasing Best Practices</strong></p>\n<p>The project culminated in the open-access publication of Deliverable 3.3, a comprehensive resource&nbsp;that captures the transfer of innovation best practices throughout the project. This publication&nbsp;showcases the activities performed to strengthen the pan-European capacity building connecting&nbsp;regions, communities and actors through a multi-layered multi-stakeholder approach. These activities&nbsp;focused on collectively sharing innovations applied to real-world NEB challenges, offering replicable&nbsp;solutions for stakeholders across Europe. Events featured in the publication highlight concrete&nbsp;examples of innovative projects, tools and actors that have shown best practices in line with the NEB&nbsp;values.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>The digiNEB.eu project has delivered significant and lasting contributions in transferring innovation&nbsp;best practices across Europe. By fostering a multi-layered, multi-stakeholder collaborative and crossdisciplinary&nbsp;network and providing access to tools, projects and actors that are successfully paving the&nbsp;way, digiNEB.eu has empowered stakeholders to actively engage with the NEB community. The&nbsp;project's outputs, from the Digital Toolkit, the online platform or the policy recommendations, ensure&nbsp;that digital innovation will continue to drive the transformation of European living spaces, making&nbsp;them more sustainable, inclusive, and beautiful for generations to come.</p>",
