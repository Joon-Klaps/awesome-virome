        "description": "<p>Agent-based modeling is indispensable for studying complex systems across many domains. However, existing simulation platforms exhibit two major issues: performance and modularity. Low performance prevents simulations with a large number of agents, increases development time, limits parameter exploration, and raises computing costs. Inflexible software designs motivate modelers to create their own tools, diverting valuable resources.</p>\n<p>This dissertation introduces a novel simulation platform called BioDynaMo and its significant improvement, TeraAgent, to alleviate these challenges via three major works.</p>\n<p>First, we lay the platform's foundation by defining abstractions, establishing software infrastructure, and implementing a multitude of features for agent-based modeling. We demonstrate BioDynaMo's modularity through use cases in neuroscience, epidemiology, and oncology. We validate these models and show the simplicity of adding new functionality with few lines of code.</p>\n<p>Second, we perform a rigorous performance analysis and identify challenges for shared-memory parallelism. Provided solutions include an optimized grid for neighbor searching, mechanisms to reduce the memory access latency, and exploiting domain knowledge to omit unnecessary work. These improvements yield up to three orders of magnitude speedups, enabling simulations of 1.7 billion agents on a single server.</p>\n<p>Third, we present TeraAgent, a distributed simulation engine that allows scaling out the computation of one simulation to multiple servers. We identify and address server communication bottlenecks and implement solutions for serialization and delta encoding to accelerate and reduce data transfer. TeraAgent can simulate 500 billion agents and scales to 84096 CPU cores.</p>\n<p><br>BioDynaMo has been widely adopted, including a prize-winning radiotherapy simulation recognized as a top 10 breakthrough in physics in 2024.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The New European Bauhaus (NEB) is a European Union initiative aimed at transforming the&nbsp;design, planning, and construction of living environments to make the green transition&nbsp;enjoyable, attractive, and accessible for all. The DigiNEB project supports this vision by&nbsp;bridging the digital and NEB communities, creating a pan-European digital ecosystem to&nbsp;promote EU digital solutions for greener, more inclusive living spaces. DigiNEB focuses on&nbsp;raising awareness, fostering collaboration, and ensuring the long-term sustainability of&nbsp;digital tools and methods within the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC)&nbsp;sector.</p>\n<p>DigiNEB outlines in this context a roadmap to ensure the long-term impact of its initiatives,&nbsp;emphasising the transfer of methods and tools to stakeholders. The roadmap aligns with the&nbsp;NEB Academy, which aims to upskill and reskill the construction ecosystem for a&nbsp;regenerative, bio-based, and circular economy.</p>\n<p><strong>Roadmap for Digital Literacy in NEB</strong></p>\n<p>The NEB Academy will serve as the central hub for collecting, supervising, and developing&nbsp;courses and training programs to support the Green Transition. To address fragmentation&nbsp;and ensure accessibility, the following steps are recommended based on the experience of&nbsp;DigiNEB:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>NEB Course Base: Establish a certified repository of courses and training options to&nbsp;unify offerings across the EU.</li>\n<li>EU Dataspace for Open Educational Resources (OER): Create a centralised&nbsp;infrastructure to share, mix, and reuse OER, integrating them into local Learning&nbsp;Management Systems.</li>\n<li>Integration of Digital and AI Literacy: Integrate digital and AI literacy into&nbsp;professional titles like \"architect,\" pushing higher education institutions to include&nbsp;these skills in their curricula.</li>\n<li>EU Micro-Credentials: Implement a standardised system for micro-credentials (3&ndash;30&nbsp;ECTS) to certify lifelong learning, ensuring recognition across EU member states.</li>\n<li>Open Badges / EuroPass: Develop a standardised system for digital badges or&nbsp;certifications to validate micro-credentials and skills acquired through lifelong&nbsp;learning.</li>\n<li>Financing Mechanism for Lifelong Learning: Establish funding mechanisms similar to&nbsp;those for traditional education to support lifelong learning initiatives.</li>\n<li>Course Localisation: Support the translation and adaptation of courses to local&nbsp;languages and regional specifications to ensure accessibility across the EU.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Timeline for Digital Literacy Roadmap:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>2020&ndash;2025: Launch the NEB Academy Alliance and pilot micro-credentials.</li>\n<li>2025&ndash;2030: Develop the NEB course base, EU dataspace for OER, and Open Badges/EuroPass system.</li>\n<li>2030&ndash;2035: Implement EU-wide micro-credentials and funding mechanisms for lifelong learning.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Roadmap for Digitalisation in NEB</strong></p>\n<p>To support the NEB&rsquo;s digital transformation, the following actions are proposed:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Cascading NEB Grants: Allocate funding to smaller NEB stakeholders through cascading grants, enabling them to participate in EU-funded projects.</li>\n<li>Open-Source Requirement: Mandate that digital tools developed through EU funding be open-source, unless restricted by knowledge security concerns.</li>\n<li>E-Learning and Citizen Platforms: Fast-track the development of open-source platforms for e-learning and citizen engagement (e.g., co-planning and local democracy tools).</li>\n<li>Digital Workflows: Focus on developing and teaching workflows how multiple tools sequentially can meet specific objectives, alongside separate tool development.</li>\n<li>Discovery Support: Enhance the dissemination of EU-funded projects by training participants in (digital) outreach and networking with local governments, NGOs, and market players.</li>\n<li>Horizon Software Space: Establish a Git repository for hosting and developing digital solutions from EU-funded projects.</li>\n<li>Interoperability: Require EU-funded projects to address the full complexity of NEB principles (beauty, sustainability, inclusion) and ensure interoperability between tools.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Timeline for Digitalisation Roadmap:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>2020&ndash;2025: Launch DigiNEB and initiate cascading grants.</li>\n<li>2025&ndash;2030: Develop open-source e-learning and citizen platforms, enforce opensource&nbsp;and interoperability requirements for EU-funded projects.</li>\n<li>2030&ndash;2035: Focus on digital workflows and establish the Horizon software space.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>DigiNEB&rsquo;s digital literacy and digitalisation roadmaps aim to create a cohesive, sustainable,&nbsp;and inclusive ecosystem for the AEC sector. By addressing gaps in funding, accessibility,&nbsp;interoperability, and digital skills, these roadmaps will support the EU&rsquo;s Green Deal and&nbsp;ensure the long-term success of the NEB initiative through the continuation in the NEB&nbsp;Academy. The integration of open education, micro-credentials, and open-source solutions&nbsp;will empower stakeholders to drive the green transition effectively.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The DigiNEB project supports the implementation of the New European Bauhaus (NEB) and&nbsp;accelerates the green transformation by increasing the adoption of NEB-aligned digital solutions. As a&nbsp;Coordination Action, DigiNEB has prioritised the identification and understanding of stakeholder&nbsp;needs to provide targeted knowledge support, networking opportunities, upskilling, and community&nbsp;participation. This document outlines the updated engagement objectives, evolving stakeholder&nbsp;groups, engagement channels, risks, and the roles and responsibilities of DigiNEB&rsquo;s partners.</p>\n<p>The DigiNEB platform aims to deepen stakeholder understanding of the New European Bauhaus,&nbsp;keep stakeholders informed of key developments, contribute to the NEB digital transformation, and&nbsp;disseminate NEB best practices. It also fosters cross-disciplinary and cross-sectoral collaboration,&nbsp;monitors the overall impact of NEB activities, and contributes to policy development and&nbsp;standardisation.</p>\n<p>In 2023, DigiNEB played a pivotal role in rallying the NEB community around the NEB Mission,&nbsp;engaging Member States to support it during a key meeting at the Council of Europe on the 12th of&nbsp;September 2023. Following this, DigiNEB gathered eminent leaders from NEB Labs and Lighthouses&nbsp;to co-author a White Paper. This document, which was included as an annexe in deliverable D4.2,&nbsp;provides strategic direction for the NEB Mission&rsquo;s evolution and its eventual transition towards the&nbsp;NEB Facility, a future-focused funding mechanism. The White Paper captures the insights of thought&nbsp;leaders from across the NEB ecosystem and serves as a foundational guide for shaping the NEB's&nbsp;future, policy, and initiatives.</p>\n<p>This final version of the updated Stakeholder Engagement Plan moves beyond addressing the initial&nbsp;catalogue of distinct target groups - architects, designers, educators, etc. Based on insights from the&nbsp;project&rsquo;s first phase and in consultation with partners, the plan has adopted a more flexible,&nbsp;mission-driven approach. This strategy unites multidisciplinary communities around topics of shared&nbsp;interest, following successful models from NEB projects such as Bauhaus of the Seas Sails, Nordic&nbsp;Carbon-Neutral Bauhaus, and Bauhaus Goes South. Aligning DigiNEB with these core themes has&nbsp;proven effective for onboarding large stakeholder pools, encouraging cross-sectoral collaboration,&nbsp;and promoting co-creation.</p>\n<p>Since the project amendment and refocus, a major upgrade to the DigiNEB website provides a more&nbsp;intuitive and user-friendly interface, enhancing stakeholder access to valuable resources such as the&nbsp;NEB Concepts modular podcast. The revamped website now functions as a central hub for&nbsp;stakeholders, offering improved navigation, interactive learning tools, and databases that support&nbsp;co-creation activities.</p>\n<p>The DigiNEB project is actively connecting with industry partners, European Digital Innovation Hubs&nbsp;(including Link&ouml;ping Science Park), the EU Capital of Innovation (Link&ouml;ping, Sweden), and a range of&nbsp;digital projects in alignment with the objectives set out in the Description of Action (DOA). Through&nbsp;the digital technical working groups/digital focus groups, a broad spectrum of stakeholders from&nbsp;different EU member and associated states has been engaged.</p>\n<p>The NEB Concepts modular podcast was created to respond to challenges in sustaining meaningful&nbsp;engagement through traditional social media. It offers a modular approach, allowing users to explore&nbsp;themes such as sustainability, design, and innovation in a flexible format that promotes deeper&nbsp;learning and engagement. This podcast represents a shift toward more substantive, long-term&nbsp;engagement strategies, moving away from the transient nature of social media.</p>\n<p>This version of the deliverable includes a substantial new section (Section 5) that reports on the final&nbsp;event of the DigiNEB project in Brussels. &lsquo;Celebrating the Lessons Learnt&rsquo; brought together 64&nbsp;thought leaders from across the wider NEB community, including Lighthouses, Labs and other&nbsp;Coordination Actions as well as policymakers. The final event also featured dynamic discussions in a&nbsp;series of 'Think and Do Tanks' to reflect on lessons learnt and formulate concrete policy&nbsp;recommendations for the NEB roadmap. These outcomes are detailed in Section 5.13.</p>\n<p>The final event launched the published Regional Innovation Model (RIM) Handbook, based on NEB&nbsp;community activities with regional governments and using the Jan &Aring;man and Adam Davies Prototype&nbsp;for an Ecosystemic Handbook as a foundation. The RIM Handbook is designed to be a companion to&nbsp;city and regional administrators. It includes practical examples of engagement and activities for local&nbsp;actors and changemakers in collaboration across sectors and disciplines. It suggests ways to think&nbsp;about grand challenges that address specific needs and characteristics of regional ecosystems while&nbsp;it offers support instruments and frameworks to leverage local intelligence and create a systemic&nbsp;shift at the global scale.</p>\n<p>By focusing on ecosystemic approaches to regional development, the handbook ensures that the&nbsp;NEB community can benefit from proven methodologies and tools that drive innovation and&nbsp;collaboration across Europe. The handbook&rsquo;s launch was further supported by commitments from&nbsp;policymakers, including the plan for a second major launch event at the European Committee of the&nbsp;Regions yearly Plenary in April 2025. This strategic dissemination ensures the handbook&rsquo;s reach&nbsp;extends to policymakers across Europe, amplifying its utility as a cornerstone of regional NEB-aligned&nbsp;innovation.</p>\n<p>In addition to these resources, the project has undergone significant development, including&nbsp;redesigning the DigiNEB website to provide a more intuitive and accessible hub for stakeholders.&nbsp;This upgraded platform offers enhanced features such as interactive learning tools, improved&nbsp;navigation, and the integration of digital co-creation methodologies.&nbsp;Stakeholder engagement has evolved significantly, culminating in the joint event with CrAFt and&nbsp;NEBula at Architect House in Brussels and the knowledge exchange at the JUST Industry Data Week&nbsp;in Link&ouml;ping. The project&rsquo;s engagement strategy emphasises data ethics and AI for social good,&nbsp;integrating these themes into broader discussions around sustainability and digital transformation.</p>\n<p>These efforts are aligned with the project's goal of fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and&nbsp;supporting the NEB mission at the European level. This deliverable underscores the integration of&nbsp;digital and co-creation methodologies into the broader NEB mission, leveraging insights from events&nbsp;such as the JUST Industry Data Week and the final Brussels event.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The DigiNEB project supports the implementation of the New European Bauhaus (NEB) and the&nbsp;acceleration of the green transformation by increasing the adoption of NEB-aligned digital solutions.&nbsp;As a Coordination Action, DigiNEB has prioritised the identification and understanding of stakeholder&nbsp;needs to provide targeted knowledge support, networking opportunities, upskilling, and community&nbsp;participation. This document outlines the updated engagement objectives, evolving stakeholder&nbsp;groups, engagement channels, risks, and the roles and responsibilities of DigiNEB&rsquo;s partners.</p>\n<p>The DigiNEB platform aims to deepen stakeholder understanding of the New European Bauhaus, keep&nbsp;stakeholders informed of key developments, contribute to the NEB digital transformation, and&nbsp;disseminate NEB best practices. It also fosters cross-disciplinary and cross-sectoral collaboration,&nbsp;monitors the overall impact of NEB activities, and contributes to policy development and&nbsp;standardisation.</p>\n<p>In 2023, DigiNEB played a pivotal role in rallying the NEB community around the NEB Mission,&nbsp;engaging Member States to support it during a key meeting at the Council of Europe on the 12th&nbsp;of September 2023. Following this, DigiNEB gathered eminent leaders from NEB Labs and&nbsp;Lighthouses to co-author a White Paper. This document, which is included as an annex to this&nbsp;report, provides strategic direction for the NEB Mission&rsquo;s evolution and its eventual transition&nbsp;towards the NEB Facility, a future-focused funding mechanism. The White Paper captures the&nbsp;insights of thought leaders from across the NEB ecosystem and serves as a foundational guide for&nbsp;shaping the NEB's future, policy, and initiatives.</p>\n<p>This updated Stakeholder Engagement Plan moves beyond addressing the initial catalogue of distinct&nbsp;target groups - architects, designers, educators, etc. Based on insights from the project&rsquo;s first phase&nbsp;and in consultation with partners, the plan has adopted a more flexible, mission-driven approach. This&nbsp;strategy unites multidisciplinary communities around topics of shared interest, following successful&nbsp;models from NEB projects such as Bauhaus of the Seas Sails, Nordic Carbon-Neutral Bauhaus and&nbsp;Bauhaus Goes South. Aligning DigiNEB with these core themes has proven effective for onboarding&nbsp;large stakeholder pools, encouraging cross-sectoral collaboration, and promoting co-creation.</p>\n<p>One key evolution is the shift in how DigiNEB engages with its digital tools and community resources.&nbsp;A major upgrade to the DigiNEB website provides a more intuitive and user-friendly interface,&nbsp;enhancing stakeholder access to valuable resources such as the Handbook for Ecosystemic Regional&nbsp;Innovation and the new NEB Concepts podcast. The revamped website now functions as a central hub&nbsp;for stakeholders, offering improved navigation, interactive learning tools, and databases that support&nbsp;co-creation activities.</p>\n<p>The DigiNEB project is actively connecting with industry partners, European Digital Innovation Hubs&nbsp;(including Link.ping Science Park), the EU Capital of Innovation (Link.ping, Sweden), and a range of&nbsp;digital projects in alignment with the objectives set out in the Description of Action (DOA). Through&nbsp;the digital technical working groups/digital focus groups, a broad spectrum of stakeholders from&nbsp;different EU member and associated states has been engaged.</p>\n<p>The NEB Concepts podcast, a new addition to the project&rsquo;s outreach tools, was created as a response&nbsp;to challenges in sustaining meaningful engagement through traditional social media. It offers a&nbsp;modular approach, allowing users to explore themes such as sustainability, design, and innovation in&nbsp;a flexible format that promotes deeper learning and engagement. This podcast represents a shift&nbsp;toward more substantive, long-term engagement strategies, moving away from the transient nature&nbsp;of social media.</p>\n<p>The Handbook for Ecosystemic Regional Innovation further supports DigiNEB&rsquo;s mission by offering&nbsp;local and regional leaders practical guidance on how to implement NEB principles within their own&nbsp;contexts. By focusing on ecosystemic approaches to regional development, the handbook ensures that&nbsp;the NEB community can benefit from proven methodologies and tools that drive innovation and&nbsp;collaboration across Europe.</p>\n<p>In addition to these resources, the project has undergone significant development, including the&nbsp;redesign of the DigiNEB website to provide a more intuitive and accessible hub for stakeholders. This&nbsp;upgraded platform offers enhanced features such as interactive learning tools, improved navigation,&nbsp;and the integration of digital co-creation methodologies.</p>\n<p>DigiNEB established a repository after the NEB@CERN event, providing an ongoing resource for&nbsp;the NEB community. This platform, initially created to support collaboration following the event,&nbsp;has led to ongoing interaction by that community of contributors, hosted by sister projects such as&nbsp;CrAft and the NEB Academy. The community unified by this milestone event at CERN has&nbsp;maintained regular dialogue, collaboration and interaction, driving forward the collective NEB&nbsp;vision.</p>\n<p>Stakeholder engagement has evolved significantly, with new strategies focusing on collaboration,&nbsp;community participation, and co-creation. Key NEB stakeholders, including policymakers, industry&nbsp;leaders, and civil society, have been actively involved in the development of best practices for regional&nbsp;innovation. The project&rsquo;s engagement strategy now emphasises data ethics and AI for social good,&nbsp;integrating these themes into broader discussions around sustainability and digital transformation.&nbsp;These efforts are aligned with the project's goal of fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and&nbsp;supporting the NEB mission at the European level.</p>\n<p>Stakeholder engagement remains a shared responsibility of all DigiNEB consortium members.&nbsp;Leveraging existing networks and connections remains a core aspect of the project&rsquo;s outreach&nbsp;strategy. Each partner continues to focus on specific areas of engagement, ensuring that the project&nbsp;benefits from a diverse range of strengths and avoids duplication of efforts. Stakeholder engagement&nbsp;has also been conducted in parallel lines of community interaction, by participation in broad interest&nbsp;community activities of DigiNEB project partners. This collaborative approach, paired with the&nbsp;updated tools and methodologies outlined in this document, positions DigiNEB to foster&nbsp;interdisciplinary collaboration and advance the NEB&rsquo;s mission effectively.</p>",

This approach builds upon an effective NEB strategy established in NEB projects&nbsp;such as Nordic Carbon-Neutral Bauhaus and Bauhaus Goes South. Each of these has developed a large&nbsp;stakeholder pool around a central theme that different stakeholders relate to. Aligning topics around&nbsp;the missions of these established communities provides an effective method for onboarding large&nbsp;numbers of NEB stakeholders. The aim is to align multiple and diverse digital technology research&nbsp;communities with these established NEB communities; build trust, encourage engagement,&nbsp;particularly between silos; and ensure two-way dialogues and multidisciplinary co-creation rather&nbsp;than simply one-way dissemination.</p>\n<p>Following this onboarding strategy, the proposed Technology Working Groups (TWGs) have been&nbsp;reframed around topics and renamed as Thematic Working Groups. This allows digiNEB.eu to build on&nbsp;NEB&rsquo;s mission-driven strategy and gather digital and NEB communities around a series of common&nbsp;themes, allowing for greater inclusivity and contributions beyond the specific categories of&nbsp;stakeholders identified in the project proposal, divided into seven categories (architects, construction&nbsp;industry, researchers, policymakers, etc.). The first event that will test this method of onboarding&nbsp;communities is being hosted by CERN IdeaSquare and will gather 50 NEB and digital stakeholders inperson&nbsp;over 2.5 days in co-creation workshops.</p>\n<p>The digiNEB.eu project has already implemented and is in the process of further implementing&nbsp;knowledge exchange and matchmaking events, webinars, educational seminars and hands-on&nbsp;innovation labs, place-based education, social media, and the activation and empowerment of early&nbsp;adopters. Results from engagement and knowledge creation will be transferred to the digital platform,&nbsp;which will provide databases, catalogues and toolkits. It will conduct community-building events,&nbsp;incentivise Early Adopters as ambassadors, publish success stories, offer a useful co-creation space&nbsp;along with valuable digital resources and assets, and amplify impacts through social media channels.</p>\n<p>Engagement with stakeholders will be the responsibility of all members of the digiNEB.eu consortium.&nbsp;Linking with partners&rsquo; existing networks and connections will be a central aspect of this outreach. In&nbsp;addition, each partner will have a specific focal area to share the workload and leverage key strengths,&nbsp;as well as to avoid duplication.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The digiNEB.eu project supports the New European Bauhaus initiative (NEB) by creating synergies&nbsp;with EU technological innovation, particularly technologies that support Smart Communities and the&nbsp;implementation of the Green Deal. This document outlines the Early Adopters Network for national&nbsp;and regional adoption of the digiNEB.eu project. It defines Early Adopters as stakeholders who have&nbsp;actively and positively engaged with digital strategies for NEB projects, Smart Communities, or&nbsp;NEB-aligned initiatives. They are distinct from \"users\" in that they are likely to encourage and&nbsp;promote the use of these strategies among colleagues and peers, as well as provide feedback and&nbsp;contribute expert knowledge that may lead to improvements in the systems implemented.</p>\n<p>The first strategy for stakeholder engagement aims to onboard key community leaders from target&nbsp;NEB and Smart Communities projects via in-person engagement. This strategy has already been&nbsp;implemented by first identifying gaps and synergies in NEB and Smart Communities engagement, and&nbsp;then by addressing them with the first in-person Early Adopter onboarding event NEB@CERN. The&nbsp;event was conceived as a high-level co-creation lab focusing on digitally-enabled approaches to&nbsp;sustainability, inclusion and aesthetics and combined inspirational talks with &lsquo;think and do tanks&rsquo; &ndash;&nbsp;co-creation sessions focusing on digiNEB priority topics. These included the new NEB Academy for a&nbsp;sustainable built environment, and synergies between NEB and digital with multidisciplinary Smart&nbsp;Communities. The NEB@CERN event resulted in multiple achievements and impacts. It created a&nbsp;new hybrid community between the digital Smart Communities projects and NEB, resulting in the&nbsp;creation of the digiNEB Early Adopter Network. The network has started to collaborate on a White&nbsp;Paper covering topics such as mission-oriented learning, closed-loop materials lifecycles, and design&nbsp;for regional ecosystems framework conditions. The community has agreed that the NEB Lighthouses&nbsp;will now host the community on a regular basis. Thematic Working Groups have been established to&nbsp;organise the collaborative White Paper, and further activities are planned as part of the TWG&nbsp;onboarding strategy.</p>\n<p>The second strategy is to develop further the Early Adopters Network by focusing in greater detail on&nbsp;common missions through Thematic Working Groups (TWGs), contributions to the digiNEB White&nbsp;Paper and the development of TWG-related thematic events. The digiNEB.eu project has agreed to&nbsp;replace \"Technical Working Groups\" with \"Thematic Working Groups\" to encourage broader&nbsp;participation by the NEB stakeholders. Thematic Working Groups have been established through&nbsp;co-creation by the digiNEB.eu community at the NEB@CERN event and updated with the latest NEB&nbsp;agenda for the NEB Academy. Onboarding of further TWG members will be done through curated&nbsp;matchmaking between leading NEB contributors and digital innovation project owners.</p>\n<p>The third Early Adopter engagement strategy focuses on the onboarding of NEB stakeholders from&nbsp;the European Regions by means of a Regional Innovation Model. The strategy leverages background&nbsp;work completed as part of NEB High Level Round Table activities during 2022 together with the&nbsp;European Committee of the Regions, in a collaboration with Commissioner Ferreira's Cohesion Funds&nbsp;and INTERREG Europe, as well as best practice from pioneering and early successes of NEB regional&nbsp;initiatives. The adopted joint proposal by Michela Magas and the European Committee of the&nbsp;Regions focuses on a Regional Innovation Model that implements an ecosystemic approach to EU&nbsp;funds by connecting existing funding mechanisms, such as Interreg Europe and Cohesion Funds, to&nbsp;create a large-scale value network and multiplier effect for local and regional sustainability&nbsp;innovation activities. In digiNEb this proposal is being combined with best practice from successful&nbsp;NEB initiatives such as Sweden&rsquo;s National NEB project &ldquo;Visions in the North&rdquo; and the related digiNEB&nbsp;Early Adopter Duved project. Best practice content for the Regional Innovation Model combines tools&nbsp;and methods for community innovation that will be disseminated to regional Early Adopters. The</p>\n<p>Regional Innovation Model Handbook is being drafted as a guide for implementing best practices&nbsp;across various regional ecosystems. The combined Regional Innovation Model implementing&nbsp;innovative processes on the ground and scaling resulting innovations from the ground up via linked&nbsp;funding mechanisms, is expected to create wide-reaching impacts on regional ecosystems, including&nbsp;pilot solutions for circular models, environments that stimulate co-creation, behavioural shifts and&nbsp;system change. A first working draft of the RIM Handbook is included as this report&rsquo;s Annexe.</p>\n<p>The fourth strategy for Early Adopter engagement focuses on onboarding through social media,&nbsp;webinars and success stories. The strategy involves cross-promotion and content sharing between&nbsp;the website and social media channels, audience engagement through interactive activities, and a&nbsp;specific campaign dedicated for building an Early Adopter Network. The implementation of this&nbsp;strategy involves the creation of an Early Adopter application form, dedicated web pages for&nbsp;onboarded Early Adopters, events with Early Adopters, and a pay-per-click campaign. The success of&nbsp;the strategy relies on the creation of meaningful content and entry points for the early adopters on&nbsp;the digiNEB.eu platform.</p>",
