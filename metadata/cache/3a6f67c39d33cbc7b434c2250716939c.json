        "description": "<p><span>The purpose of this study was to assess the initiatives, support, and challenges in the establishment and sustainability of Learning Resource Centers (LRCs) in public elementary schools across the three congressional districts of Bohol during the school year 2024&ndash;2025. Employing a qualitative research design, the study gathered data through interviews and focus group discussions with school supervisors, principals, and teachers. Thematic analysis was used to categorize responses into major themes that addressed the schools&rsquo; initiatives, internal and external stakeholder support, encountered challenges, and proposed measures for improvement. Findings revealed that despite financial limitations, schools demonstrated proactive efforts to develop LRCs, often repurposing unused spaces and launching community-driven resource mobilization initiatives. Support from parents, alumni, local government units, and non-government organizations proved crucial in sustaining LRC operations. However, challenges such as outdated materials, limited digital resources, and inadequate space continued to hinder LRC effectiveness. Respondents recommended practical strategies including local fundraising, digital resource integration, stakeholder engagement, and structured LRC management systems. The study concludes that the development and sustainability of LRCs require collaborative efforts, innovative solutions, and continuous evaluation. These findings serve as a valuable basis for educational leaders and policymakers to design programs and policies that enhance LRC services and improve the overall quality of education in public schools.</span></p>",

        "description": "<p>The subject of this research is the systematization of key concepts that form the foundation of<br>strategic innovation management and transformation management in the context of the modern economy.</p>\n<p>The study focuses on analyzing concepts of innovation development, digital transformations, change<br>management, and strategic planning in the adaptation of enterprises to a dynamic market environment.<br>Special attention is given to identifying the interconnections between innovation processes and<br>managerial decisions aimed at creating long&ndash;term competitive advantages. Additionally, the study<br>examines the main approaches to the classification of innovations, their impact on business models,<br>and the mechanisms for adapting to technological and socio&ndash;economic changes.<br>The results of this research will contribute to the formation of theoretical foundations for effective<br>innovation management and the development of methodological recommendations for implementing<br>strategic transformations in various fields of activity.<br>Research Objective. The aim of this study is to systematize key research concepts in the context<br>of strategic innovation management and transformation management. The research focuses on<br>determining the interrelations between fundamental categories of innovation development, strategic<br>management, and organizational change. Special attention is paid to methodological approaches to<br>analyzing innovation transformations that ensure the long&ndash;term competitiveness of enterprises.<br>The findings of the study will deepen the scientific understanding of strategic change processes and<br>contribute to the formation of effective managerial decisions in a dynamic market environment.<br>Research Methodology. The research methodology is based on systematic, strategic, and<br>innovation&ndash;oriented approaches to analyzing key concepts related to strategic innovation management<br>and transformation management. The primary goal of the methodological approach is to create a<br>generalized model for the systematization of concepts in the context of modern trends in strategic<br>management and innovation development.<br>The study relies on a comprehensive analysis of scientific sources covering concepts of strategic<br>management, innovation development, and digital transformations. Content analysis was used to<br>identify the most common terms, definitions, and their interconnections in contemporary literature.<br>Additionally, comparative analysis methods were employed to juxtapose different approaches to<br>interpreting key concepts and to identify their common and distinctive features. To ensure the<br>structural integrity of the research, a systematic approach was applied, which considers key concepts<br>through the lens of their role in strategic innovation management and transformation processes.<br>This approach allows for the identification of interdependencies between organizational innovation<br>development, change management, and long&ndash;term corporate strategies.<br>The expert evaluation method was employed to determine the relevance of key concepts in the context<br>of modern business realities and their role in shaping organizational development strategies. Surveys<br>of experts in strategic management, digital transformations, and innovation development helped<br>refine the interpretation of core categories and assess their practical significance. Furthermore, the<br>research relies on modeling methods that enable the creation of a logical structure of interconnections<br>among key concepts within strategic innovation management and transformation management.<br>The developed model provides insight into the integration of innovation processes into corporate<br>governance and their impact on business efficiency.<br>Thus, the study is based on systematic analysis, comparative approaches, content analysis,<br>expert evaluation, and modeling. The methodological approaches used allow for the development of<br>a comprehensive system for systematizing key research concepts and determining their impact on<br>strategic innovation management and transformation management.<br>Research Results. In the course of this study, a systematization of key concepts in the context of<br>strategic innovation management and transformation management was carried out. It was determined<br>that strategic innovation management encompasses a comprehensive approach to implementing<br>changes, including the development of long&ndash;term strategies, optimization of business processes, and<br>the use of modern technologies. Particular attention was given to analyzing the interrelation between<br>innovation development, adaptation to change, and the formation of competitive advantages.<br>Various methodological approaches to studying transformation processes were examined, including the systemic, process&ndash;based, and resource&ndash;based approaches, as well as economic&ndash;mathematical<br>modeling. It was found that effective transformation management requires synergy between external<br>and internal factors, with digitalization, flexible strategic planning, and organizational culture playing a<br>key role in this process.<br>The results of the analysis confirm the importance of adaptive strategies, which enable companies<br>to enhance their resilience to change and minimize risks. The primary mechanisms ensuring effective<br>transformation management were identified, including the implementation of innovative business<br>models, leadership development, and digital technology integration.<br>Thus, the proposed systematization of key concepts contributes to the formation of a clear<br>methodological foundation for further research in the field of strategic innovation management.<br>Conclusions. In the course of this study, a comprehensive analysis of the systematization of key<br>concepts within strategic innovation management and transformation management was conducted.<br>It was determined that innovation processes are an integral component of modern organizational<br>management, as they define a company&rsquo;s ability to adapt to changes, maintain competitiveness, and<br>ensure sustainable growth. The importance of systematizing concepts in this field is driven by the<br>need to unify terminology, which enables a clear delineation of interconnections between strategic<br>management, innovation processes, and transformations.<br>The study confirmed that effective management of transformation processes requires a<br>comprehensive approach that includes an analysis of both internal and external influencing factors.<br>The external environment presents challenges for businesses, compelling organizations to seek new<br>development pathways through technological innovations, digitalization, business model changes,<br>and the implementation of advanced strategic solutions. At the same time, internal factors such as<br>corporate culture, personnel competency levels, management flexibility, and leadership effectiveness<br>determine a company&rsquo;s ability to rapidly adapt and successfully implement changes.<br>The key concepts of strategic innovation management include open innovation, dynamic capabilities,<br>resource&ndash;based theory, and the implementation of innovative business models. It was found that open<br>innovation enables organizations to make more effective use of both internal and external sources<br>of knowledge, enhancing the efficiency of transformation processes. Dynamic capabilities define an<br>organization&rsquo;s ability to swiftly adapt to changes, whereas the resource&ndash;based approach emphasizes<br>the optimal utilization of resources to ensure strategic development.<br>Transformation management requires the implementation of methodologically grounded approaches,<br>among which systemic, process&ndash;based, and resource&ndash;based analyses play a crucial role. The use<br>of economic&ndash;mathematical modeling facilitates the assessment of the effectiveness of innovation<br>implementation and its impact on the long&ndash;term sustainability of enterprises. The study confirmed that<br>the successful realization of transformational changes largely depends on digitalization processes, the<br>integration of advanced technologies, and the creation of an effective innovation ecosystem.<br>Thus, the results of the analysis confirm that the systematization of concepts within strategic innovation<br>management is essential for the further development of scientific approaches to transformation<br>management. It allows for more effective integration of modern managerial methodologies, enhances<br>organizational flexibility, and fosters sustainable competitive advantages. Future research may focus<br>on developing new models for assessing the effectiveness of strategic innovation management,<br>considering industry&ndash;specific characteristics and regional economic development factors.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Nursing is a profession with high job demands and irregular working hours, which often lead to conflicts between work and family responsibilities. This condition can trigger Work-Family Conflict (WFC), which negatively affects nurses' subjective well-being. Perceived Supervisor Support (PSS) is considered an important factor in mitigating the negative effects of WFC. This study aims to examine the influence of work-family conflict on subjective well-being and to investigate the moderating role of perceived supervisor support. This research employed a quantitative approach using a questionnaire method. A total of 132 nurses from private hospitals in South Lampung Regency were selected through simple random sampling. The instruments used in this study were the work-family conflict scale, subjective well-being scale, and perceived supervisor support scale. Data were analyzed using Moderated Regression Analysis (MRA) with the assistance of SPSS software. The results showed that work-family conflict had a significant negative effect on nurses&rsquo; subjective well-being. Furthermore, perceived supervisor support was proven to moderate the relationship between work-family conflict and subjective well-being. High levels of supervisor support were found to weaken the negative impact of work-family conflict on nurses&rsquo; well-being. In conclusion, work-family conflict can reduce the subjective well-being of nurses; however, this effect can be minimized through strong perceived supervisor support. These findings highlight the crucial role of supervisors in creating a supportive work environment to maintain the psychological well-being of nursing staff.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The subject of this study is the assessment of the investment climate in the construction sector,<br>the identification of key challenges and institutional factors influencing the processes of managing<br>strategic transformations of construction enterprises&ndash;stakeholders. The research examines economic,<br>regulatory, and social aspects that determine the attractiveness of investments in the construction<br>sector, as well as the factors that either constrain or stimulate the long&ndash;term development of the<br>industry. Special attention is paid to the analysis of the institutional environment, covering government<br>policies, legal mechanisms, financial support, and international regulatory standards.<br>The study also explores stakeholder interactions, including investors, government authorities,<br>construction companies, financial institutions, and public organizations. It has been established that<br>effective management of investment flows and strategic transformations is possible only under a<br>balanced market regulation approach, stimulation of innovative strategies, and the use of analytical<br>tools for forecasting market changes.<br>The purpose of this study is to analyze the investment climate and define the methodological<br>foundations for managing the strategic transformations of construction enterprises while considering<br>institutional factors and market challenges. The main focus is on developing approaches to assessing<br>the level of investment attractiveness in the construction sector, identifying barriers to development,<br>and formulating recommendations to improve the efficiency of investment attraction.<br>The study examines key macroeconomic and microeconomic factors affecting the strategic planning<br>of construction enterprises and their adaptation to new market conditions. An analytical approach to<br>modeling transformational processes is proposed, which allows evaluating the effectiveness of change<br>management, optimizing investment strategies, and enhancing the competitiveness of construction<br>companies in the long&ndash;term perspective.<br>The research methodology is based on systemic and structural&ndash;functional approaches, which<br>allow for the assessment of the interrelationship between institutional factors, investment climate, and<br>mechanisms of strategic transformations in construction enterprises. Within the study, an analysis<br>of the investment environment was conducted using comparative analysis methods and economic&ndash;statistical modeling. Key indicators such as the level of foreign direct investment, construction market<br>dynamics, regulatory changes, and the innovation potential of enterprises were evaluated, enabling<br>the identification of major trends and challenges for the industry.<br>A crucial stage of the study involved identifying the key challenges and risks affecting the<br>development of the construction sector. For this purpose, a SWOT analysis method was applied,<br>allowing for an evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the sector, potential opportunities, and<br>threats posed by the macroeconomic environment. This was supplemented by expert assessment<br>methods, which helped highlight the most pressing issues that hamper investment activity and reduce<br>the effectiveness of strategic transformations.<br>One of the key directions of the research was the examination of institutional factors influencing the<br>investment climate in the construction sector. In this context, a comparative analysis of legal mechanisms<br>governing investment conditions was carried out. The study considered tax incentives, investment<br>benefits, state support programs, and compliance with international market regulation standards.<br>The analysis of strategic transformations in enterprises was conducted using scenario forecasting,<br>econometric analysis, and structural modeling methods. Various approaches to optimizing business<br>models, digital transformation, improving resource efficiency, and implementing innovations were explored,<br>providing a comprehensive view of enterprise adaptation mechanisms in dynamic market conditions.<br>Based on the obtained results, recommendations for improving the investment climate were<br>developed, focusing on an investment management model that considers market challenges and<br>regulatory specifics. Mechanisms for enhancing the institutional environment were identified,<br>aimed at increasing market transparency, reducing investment risks, and stimulating the strategic<br>development of stakeholder enterprises.<br>Thus, the research methodology not only facilitates the identification of optimal investment attraction<br>strategies but also enhances risk management efficiency and contributes to the development of scientifically<br>grounded approaches for implementing strategic transformations in the construction industry.<br>Research Results. The study analyzed institutional factors that determine the investment climate<br>and strategic transformations of construction enterprises. It was established that the effectiveness<br>of strategic change management in the construction industry largely depends on the regulatory<br>environment, economic stability, state investment policies, and the innovation activity of enterprises.<br>A comprehensive analysis of macro&ndash; and microeconomic indicators was conducted, allowing for an<br>assessment of the key challenges affecting the development of the construction sector, including<br>barriers to attracting investment and factors contributing to the stable growth of the industry.<br>The research confirmed the importance of strategic approaches to change management, particularly<br>through the implementation of digital technologies, process automation, and modernization of<br>management mechanisms. The analysis of the institutional environment demonstrated that the<br>legal regulatory framework, tax incentives, access to financial resources, and government support<br>measures significantly impact the level of investment activity in the sector.<br>A model for investment management was developed, taking into account market challenges and<br>regulatory specifics, enabling enterprises to adapt to shifts in market conditions. Additionally, the<br>study confirmed the effectiveness of econometric analysis and scenario forecasting in evaluating the<br>long&ndash;term sustainability of enterprises.<br>The proposed recommendations are aimed at enhancing the transparency of the construction<br>market, optimizing investment processes, and creating favorable conditions for the strategic<br>development of enterprises.<br>Conclusions. The conducted study confirmed that strategic transformations of construction<br>enterprises depend on the quality of the investment climate, the efficiency of institutional regulation,<br>and the ability to adapt to modern economic challenges. Institutional factors, including legal regulations,<br>financial policies, and international standards, play a key role in determining inve Significant attention was given to the need for an integrated system of investment flow management,<br>which would allow more efficient resource utilization, risk minimization, and stable enterprise growth.<br>A crucial role in this process is played by digital technologies, which contribute to process automation,<br>improved analytics, and increased transparency in investment activities.<br>The study demonstrated that optimizing management strategies in the construction industry is<br>possible if both internal and external factors influencing market dynamics are taken into account.<br>The successful implementation of strategic transformations requires active cooperation between<br>the state, investors, enterprises, and financial institutions, which would contribute to enhancing the<br>sector&rsquo;s investment attractiveness.<br>Thus, the study confirms the necessity of a comprehensive approach to managing strategic<br>transformations, which includes the use of innovative models, digital tools, and adaptive management<br>strategies. The proposed approaches and recommendations can serve as a foundation for the<br>development of new mechanisms aimed at increasing the competitiveness of construction enterprises<br>in the long&ndash;term perspective.</p>",

        "description": "<p><strong><span>R&eacute;sum&eacute;</span></strong></p>\n<p><span>Cette revue syst&eacute;matique de la litt&eacute;rature examine l&rsquo;impact de la digitalisation de la commande publique, notamment via l&rsquo;adoption de l&rsquo;e-procurement, sur les petites et moyennes entreprises (PME). Bas&eacute;e sur l&rsquo;analyse rigoureuse de 66 &eacute;tudes publi&eacute;es entre 2005 et 2025, s&eacute;lectionn&eacute;es &agrave; partir de bases de donn&eacute;es reconnues (Scopus, Web of Science, etc.), cette &eacute;tude explore les opportunit&eacute;s et d&eacute;fis associ&eacute;s &agrave; cette transformation num&eacute;rique. Les r&eacute;sultats r&eacute;v&egrave;lent que la digitalisation offre aux PME un acc&egrave;s accru aux march&eacute;s publics, une r&eacute;duction des co&ucirc;ts administratifs et une comp&eacute;titivit&eacute; renforc&eacute;e, gr&acirc;ce &agrave; des processus simplifi&eacute;s et une transparence accrue. Cependant, des obstacles significatifs persistent, tels que les barri&egrave;res technologiques, le manque de comp&eacute;tences num&eacute;riques et les contraintes de ressources, particuli&egrave;rement dans des contextes comme le Maroc. Pour tirer pleinement parti de la digitalisation, les PME doivent d&eacute;velopper leurs capacit&eacute;s dynamiques, c'est-&agrave;-dire leur aptitude &agrave; int&eacute;grer de nouvelles technologies, &agrave; adapter leurs processus et &agrave; reconfigurer leurs ressources pour r&eacute;pondre aux exigences changeantes des march&eacute;s publics num&eacute;riques. La revue met en &eacute;vidence l&rsquo;importance d&rsquo;un leadership engag&eacute;, d&rsquo;un alignement strat&eacute;gique et de politiques publiques adapt&eacute;es pour maximiser les b&eacute;n&eacute;fices de la digitalisation et soutenir le d&eacute;veloppement de ces capacit&eacute;s dynamiques. Ainsi, une approche multidimensionnelle combinant investissements technologiques et accompagnement cibl&eacute; des PME est recommand&eacute;e pour favoriser leur inclusion dans les march&eacute;s publics num&eacute;riques. Les recherches futures devraient privil&eacute;gier des &eacute;tudes empiriques pour &eacute;valuer les impacts r&eacute;els et identifier les meilleures pratiques, avec une attention particuli&egrave;re aux sp&eacute;cificit&eacute;s des pays en d&eacute;veloppement. En conclusion, si la digitalisation de la commande publique rec&egrave;le un potentiel transformateur ind&eacute;niable pour l'inclusion des PME, sa concr&eacute;tisation effective et &eacute;quitable reste conditionn&eacute;e par la mise en &oelig;uvre d'approches multidimensionnelles int&eacute;grant soutien technologique, d&eacute;veloppement des capacit&eacute;s et politiques publiques adapt&eacute;es aux contextes nationaux sp&eacute;cifiques.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Mots-cl&eacute;s :</span></strong><span> Digitalisation, commande publique, petites et moyennes entreprises, e-procurement, march&eacute;s publics, capacit&eacute;s dynamiques.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Abstract </span></strong></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">This systematic literature review assesses the impact of digitalizing public procurement, notably via e-procurement, on Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). Drawing on a thorough analysis of 66 studies (2005-2025) from reputable databases like Scopus and Web of Science, this research investigates the opportunities and challenges stemming from this digital shift. Results indicate that digitalization provides SMEs with greater public market access, lower administrative burdens, and improved competitiveness, facilitated by streamlined procedures and enhanced transparency. Nevertheless, significant hurdles remain, such as technological barriers, digital skill gaps, and resource limitations, especially evident in developing nations like Morocco. Fully harnessing digitalization requires SMEs to cultivate dynamic capabilities: the aptitude to integrate new technologies, adjust internal processes, and realign resources according to the changing requirements of digital public procurement. The review underscores the crucial role of dedicated leadership, strategic alignment, and appropriate public policies in maximizing benefits and fostering these dynamic capabilities. Consequently, a multi-faceted strategy combining technological investments with targeted SME support is recommended to promote their inclusion in digital public markets. Future research ought to focus on empirical studies to gauge actual impacts and pinpoint best practices, paying close attention to the unique circumstances of developing countries. In conclusion, while the digitalization of public procurement offers undeniable transformative potential for SME inclusion, its effective and equitable actualization depends on the implementation of multidimensional approaches integrating technological support, capacity development, and public policies tailored to specific national contexts.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Keywords:</span></strong><span lang=\"EN-US\"> Digitalization, public procurement, small and medium-sized enterprises, e-procurement, public markets, dynamic capabilities.</span></p>",
