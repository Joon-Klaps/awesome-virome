        "description": "<p>The DigiNEB project supports the implementation of the New European Bauhaus (NEB) and&nbsp;accelerates the green transformation by increasing the adoption of NEB-aligned digital solutions. As a&nbsp;Coordination Action, DigiNEB has prioritised the identification and understanding of stakeholder&nbsp;needs to provide targeted knowledge support, networking opportunities, upskilling, and community&nbsp;participation. This document outlines the updated engagement objectives, evolving stakeholder&nbsp;groups, engagement channels, risks, and the roles and responsibilities of DigiNEB&rsquo;s partners.</p>\n<p>The DigiNEB platform aims to deepen stakeholder understanding of the New European Bauhaus,&nbsp;keep stakeholders informed of key developments, contribute to the NEB digital transformation, and&nbsp;disseminate NEB best practices. It also fosters cross-disciplinary and cross-sectoral collaboration,&nbsp;monitors the overall impact of NEB activities, and contributes to policy development and&nbsp;standardisation.</p>\n<p>In 2023, DigiNEB played a pivotal role in rallying the NEB community around the NEB Mission,&nbsp;engaging Member States to support it during a key meeting at the Council of Europe on the 12th of&nbsp;September 2023. Following this, DigiNEB gathered eminent leaders from NEB Labs and Lighthouses&nbsp;to co-author a White Paper. This document, which was included as an annexe in deliverable D4.2,&nbsp;provides strategic direction for the NEB Mission&rsquo;s evolution and its eventual transition towards the&nbsp;NEB Facility, a future-focused funding mechanism. The White Paper captures the insights of thought&nbsp;leaders from across the NEB ecosystem and serves as a foundational guide for shaping the NEB's&nbsp;future, policy, and initiatives.</p>\n<p>This final version of the updated Stakeholder Engagement Plan moves beyond addressing the initial&nbsp;catalogue of distinct target groups - architects, designers, educators, etc. Based on insights from the&nbsp;project&rsquo;s first phase and in consultation with partners, the plan has adopted a more flexible,&nbsp;mission-driven approach. This strategy unites multidisciplinary communities around topics of shared&nbsp;interest, following successful models from NEB projects such as Bauhaus of the Seas Sails, Nordic&nbsp;Carbon-Neutral Bauhaus, and Bauhaus Goes South. Aligning DigiNEB with these core themes has&nbsp;proven effective for onboarding large stakeholder pools, encouraging cross-sectoral collaboration,&nbsp;and promoting co-creation.</p>\n<p>Since the project amendment and refocus, a major upgrade to the DigiNEB website provides a more&nbsp;intuitive and user-friendly interface, enhancing stakeholder access to valuable resources such as the&nbsp;NEB Concepts modular podcast. The revamped website now functions as a central hub for&nbsp;stakeholders, offering improved navigation, interactive learning tools, and databases that support&nbsp;co-creation activities.</p>\n<p>The DigiNEB project is actively connecting with industry partners, European Digital Innovation Hubs&nbsp;(including Link&ouml;ping Science Park), the EU Capital of Innovation (Link&ouml;ping, Sweden), and a range of&nbsp;digital projects in alignment with the objectives set out in the Description of Action (DOA). Through&nbsp;the digital technical working groups/digital focus groups, a broad spectrum of stakeholders from&nbsp;different EU member and associated states has been engaged.</p>\n<p>The NEB Concepts modular podcast was created to respond to challenges in sustaining meaningful&nbsp;engagement through traditional social media. It offers a modular approach, allowing users to explore&nbsp;themes such as sustainability, design, and innovation in a flexible format that promotes deeper&nbsp;learning and engagement. This podcast represents a shift toward more substantive, long-term&nbsp;engagement strategies, moving away from the transient nature of social media.</p>\n<p>This version of the deliverable includes a substantial new section (Section 5) that reports on the final&nbsp;event of the DigiNEB project in Brussels. &lsquo;Celebrating the Lessons Learnt&rsquo; brought together 64&nbsp;thought leaders from across the wider NEB community, including Lighthouses, Labs and other&nbsp;Coordination Actions as well as policymakers. The final event also featured dynamic discussions in a&nbsp;series of 'Think and Do Tanks' to reflect on lessons learnt and formulate concrete policy&nbsp;recommendations for the NEB roadmap. These outcomes are detailed in Section 5.13.</p>\n<p>The final event launched the published Regional Innovation Model (RIM) Handbook, based on NEB&nbsp;community activities with regional governments and using the Jan &Aring;man and Adam Davies Prototype&nbsp;for an Ecosystemic Handbook as a foundation. The RIM Handbook is designed to be a companion to&nbsp;city and regional administrators. It includes practical examples of engagement and activities for local&nbsp;actors and changemakers in collaboration across sectors and disciplines. It suggests ways to think&nbsp;about grand challenges that address specific needs and characteristics of regional ecosystems while&nbsp;it offers support instruments and frameworks to leverage local intelligence and create a systemic&nbsp;shift at the global scale.</p>\n<p>By focusing on ecosystemic approaches to regional development, the handbook ensures that the&nbsp;NEB community can benefit from proven methodologies and tools that drive innovation and&nbsp;collaboration across Europe. The handbook&rsquo;s launch was further supported by commitments from&nbsp;policymakers, including the plan for a second major launch event at the European Committee of the&nbsp;Regions yearly Plenary in April 2025. This strategic dissemination ensures the handbook&rsquo;s reach&nbsp;extends to policymakers across Europe, amplifying its utility as a cornerstone of regional NEB-aligned&nbsp;innovation.</p>\n<p>In addition to these resources, the project has undergone significant development, including&nbsp;redesigning the DigiNEB website to provide a more intuitive and accessible hub for stakeholders.&nbsp;This upgraded platform offers enhanced features such as interactive learning tools, improved&nbsp;navigation, and the integration of digital co-creation methodologies.&nbsp;Stakeholder engagement has evolved significantly, culminating in the joint event with CrAFt and&nbsp;NEBula at Architect House in Brussels and the knowledge exchange at the JUST Industry Data Week&nbsp;in Link&ouml;ping. The project&rsquo;s engagement strategy emphasises data ethics and AI for social good,&nbsp;integrating these themes into broader discussions around sustainability and digital transformation.</p>\n<p>These efforts are aligned with the project's goal of fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and&nbsp;supporting the NEB mission at the European level. This deliverable underscores the integration of&nbsp;digital and co-creation methodologies into the broader NEB mission, leveraging insights from events&nbsp;such as the JUST Industry Data Week and the final Brussels event.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The DigiNEB project supports the implementation of the New European Bauhaus (NEB) and the&nbsp;acceleration of the green transformation by increasing the adoption of NEB-aligned digital solutions.&nbsp;As a Coordination Action, DigiNEB has prioritised the identification and understanding of stakeholder&nbsp;needs to provide targeted knowledge support, networking opportunities, upskilling, and community&nbsp;participation. This document outlines the updated engagement objectives, evolving stakeholder&nbsp;groups, engagement channels, risks, and the roles and responsibilities of DigiNEB&rsquo;s partners.</p>\n<p>The DigiNEB platform aims to deepen stakeholder understanding of the New European Bauhaus, keep&nbsp;stakeholders informed of key developments, contribute to the NEB digital transformation, and&nbsp;disseminate NEB best practices. It also fosters cross-disciplinary and cross-sectoral collaboration,&nbsp;monitors the overall impact of NEB activities, and contributes to policy development and&nbsp;standardisation.</p>\n<p>In 2023, DigiNEB played a pivotal role in rallying the NEB community around the NEB Mission,&nbsp;engaging Member States to support it during a key meeting at the Council of Europe on the 12th&nbsp;of September 2023. Following this, DigiNEB gathered eminent leaders from NEB Labs and&nbsp;Lighthouses to co-author a White Paper. This document, which is included as an annex to this&nbsp;report, provides strategic direction for the NEB Mission&rsquo;s evolution and its eventual transition&nbsp;towards the NEB Facility, a future-focused funding mechanism. The White Paper captures the&nbsp;insights of thought leaders from across the NEB ecosystem and serves as a foundational guide for&nbsp;shaping the NEB's future, policy, and initiatives.</p>\n<p>This updated Stakeholder Engagement Plan moves beyond addressing the initial catalogue of distinct&nbsp;target groups - architects, designers, educators, etc. Based on insights from the project&rsquo;s first phase&nbsp;and in consultation with partners, the plan has adopted a more flexible, mission-driven approach. This&nbsp;strategy unites multidisciplinary communities around topics of shared interest, following successful&nbsp;models from NEB projects such as Bauhaus of the Seas Sails, Nordic Carbon-Neutral Bauhaus and&nbsp;Bauhaus Goes South. Aligning DigiNEB with these core themes has proven effective for onboarding&nbsp;large stakeholder pools, encouraging cross-sectoral collaboration, and promoting co-creation.</p>\n<p>One key evolution is the shift in how DigiNEB engages with its digital tools and community resources.&nbsp;A major upgrade to the DigiNEB website provides a more intuitive and user-friendly interface,&nbsp;enhancing stakeholder access to valuable resources such as the Handbook for Ecosystemic Regional&nbsp;Innovation and the new NEB Concepts podcast. The revamped website now functions as a central hub&nbsp;for stakeholders, offering improved navigation, interactive learning tools, and databases that support&nbsp;co-creation activities.</p>\n<p>The DigiNEB project is actively connecting with industry partners, European Digital Innovation Hubs&nbsp;(including Link.ping Science Park), the EU Capital of Innovation (Link.ping, Sweden), and a range of&nbsp;digital projects in alignment with the objectives set out in the Description of Action (DOA). Through&nbsp;the digital technical working groups/digital focus groups, a broad spectrum of stakeholders from&nbsp;different EU member and associated states has been engaged.</p>\n<p>The NEB Concepts podcast, a new addition to the project&rsquo;s outreach tools, was created as a response&nbsp;to challenges in sustaining meaningful engagement through traditional social media. It offers a&nbsp;modular approach, allowing users to explore themes such as sustainability, design, and innovation in&nbsp;a flexible format that promotes deeper learning and engagement. This podcast represents a shift&nbsp;toward more substantive, long-term engagement strategies, moving away from the transient nature&nbsp;of social media.</p>\n<p>The Handbook for Ecosystemic Regional Innovation further supports DigiNEB&rsquo;s mission by offering&nbsp;local and regional leaders practical guidance on how to implement NEB principles within their own&nbsp;contexts. By focusing on ecosystemic approaches to regional development, the handbook ensures that&nbsp;the NEB community can benefit from proven methodologies and tools that drive innovation and&nbsp;collaboration across Europe.</p>\n<p>In addition to these resources, the project has undergone significant development, including the&nbsp;redesign of the DigiNEB website to provide a more intuitive and accessible hub for stakeholders. This&nbsp;upgraded platform offers enhanced features such as interactive learning tools, improved navigation,&nbsp;and the integration of digital co-creation methodologies.</p>\n<p>DigiNEB established a repository after the NEB@CERN event, providing an ongoing resource for&nbsp;the NEB community. This platform, initially created to support collaboration following the event,&nbsp;has led to ongoing interaction by that community of contributors, hosted by sister projects such as&nbsp;CrAft and the NEB Academy. The community unified by this milestone event at CERN has&nbsp;maintained regular dialogue, collaboration and interaction, driving forward the collective NEB&nbsp;vision.</p>\n<p>Stakeholder engagement has evolved significantly, with new strategies focusing on collaboration,&nbsp;community participation, and co-creation. Key NEB stakeholders, including policymakers, industry&nbsp;leaders, and civil society, have been actively involved in the development of best practices for regional&nbsp;innovation. The project&rsquo;s engagement strategy now emphasises data ethics and AI for social good,&nbsp;integrating these themes into broader discussions around sustainability and digital transformation.&nbsp;These efforts are aligned with the project's goal of fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and&nbsp;supporting the NEB mission at the European level.</p>\n<p>Stakeholder engagement remains a shared responsibility of all DigiNEB consortium members.&nbsp;Leveraging existing networks and connections remains a core aspect of the project&rsquo;s outreach&nbsp;strategy. Each partner continues to focus on specific areas of engagement, ensuring that the project&nbsp;benefits from a diverse range of strengths and avoids duplication of efforts. Stakeholder engagement&nbsp;has also been conducted in parallel lines of community interaction, by participation in broad interest&nbsp;community activities of DigiNEB project partners. This collaborative approach, paired with the&nbsp;updated tools and methodologies outlined in this document, positions DigiNEB to foster&nbsp;interdisciplinary collaboration and advance the NEB&rsquo;s mission effectively.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The digiNEB.eu project supports the implementation of the New European Bauhaus (NEB) and the&nbsp;speeding up of the green transformation by increasing the adoption of NEB digital solutions.&nbsp;digiNEB.eu is a Coordination Action, and as such, it is imperative to identify and understand&nbsp;stakeholder needs to respond to them and provide the required knowledge support, networking,&nbsp;upskilling and community participation. This document outlines the engagement objectives, target&nbsp;stakeholder groups, engagement channels, risks, and partners' engagement roles and responsibilities&nbsp;for the digiNEB.eu initiative.</p>\n<p>The digiNEB.eu platform aims to increase stakeholder understanding of the New European Bauhaus,&nbsp;keep stakeholders well-informed, contribute to the digital transformation, disseminate NEB best&nbsp;practices, enable cross-disciplinary and cross-sectoral collaboration, monitor the global impact of NEB&nbsp;and inform standardisation and policy.</p>\n<p>The Stakeholder Engagement Plan goes beyond addressing a catalogue of the traditional target groups&nbsp;that might ordinarily be expected when joining digital stakeholders with particular areas of specialism&nbsp;(architects, designers, educators&hellip;). Following partner consultations, the plan has been evolved with&nbsp;a new approach that draws together multidisciplinary communities around a series of topics of&nbsp;common interest. This approach builds upon an effective NEB strategy established in NEB projects&nbsp;such as Nordic Carbon-Neutral Bauhaus and Bauhaus Goes South. Each of these has developed a large&nbsp;stakeholder pool around a central theme that different stakeholders relate to. Aligning topics around&nbsp;the missions of these established communities provides an effective method for onboarding large&nbsp;numbers of NEB stakeholders. The aim is to align multiple and diverse digital technology research&nbsp;communities with these established NEB communities; build trust, encourage engagement,&nbsp;particularly between silos; and ensure two-way dialogues and multidisciplinary co-creation rather&nbsp;than simply one-way dissemination.</p>\n<p>Following this onboarding strategy, the proposed Technology Working Groups (TWGs) have been&nbsp;reframed around topics and renamed as Thematic Working Groups. This allows digiNEB.eu to build on&nbsp;NEB&rsquo;s mission-driven strategy and gather digital and NEB communities around a series of common&nbsp;themes, allowing for greater inclusivity and contributions beyond the specific categories of&nbsp;stakeholders identified in the project proposal, divided into seven categories (architects, construction&nbsp;industry, researchers, policymakers, etc.). The first event that will test this method of onboarding&nbsp;communities is being hosted by CERN IdeaSquare and will gather 50 NEB and digital stakeholders inperson&nbsp;over 2.5 days in co-creation workshops.</p>\n<p>The digiNEB.eu project has already implemented and is in the process of further implementing&nbsp;knowledge exchange and matchmaking events, webinars, educational seminars and hands-on&nbsp;innovation labs, place-based education, social media, and the activation and empowerment of early&nbsp;adopters. Results from engagement and knowledge creation will be transferred to the digital platform,&nbsp;which will provide databases, catalogues and toolkits. It will conduct community-building events,&nbsp;incentivise Early Adopters as ambassadors, publish success stories, offer a useful co-creation space&nbsp;along with valuable digital resources and assets, and amplify impacts through social media channels.</p>\n<p>Engagement with stakeholders will be the responsibility of all members of the digiNEB.eu consortium.&nbsp;Linking with partners&rsquo; existing networks and connections will be a central aspect of this outreach. In&nbsp;addition, each partner will have a specific focal area to share the workload and leverage key strengths,&nbsp;as well as to avoid duplication.</p>",

Scopus and Web of Science (WOS) were the databases employed, as they are the most frequently employed for bibliometric analysis (Pranckut\u0117, 2021). The review protocol was designed based on the type of study. The methodology and guidelines recommended by the Joanna Briggs Institute (Peters et al., 2020) as cited in Medina-C&oacute;rdoba et al. (2023) were followed, as well as the PRISMA reporting guidelines \"Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR)\" (Tricco et al., 2018 cited by Medina-C&oacute;rdoba et al. 2023).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Data collection procedures</strong></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Source identification for this study will be conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Criteria for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, which detail procedures for identifying papers for inclusion in systematic analyses of research reviews (Page et al., 2021). The review will focus on articles published in journals indexed in Scopus and Web of Science (WOS) in both English and Spanish. Conference papers, conference proceedings, books and book chapters will be excluded, since articles from peer-reviewed journals go through a more rigorous publication process and are considered more reliable in the academic field (Hallinger, 2020).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Stopping rule</strong></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The size of the articles will be controlled by the number of articles that the time frame chosen for this scoping review yields, which covers the last ten years (January 2013 to March 2024 - one decade and 3 months) in the databases that will be used, Scopus and Web of Science (WOS).</p>"

        "description": "<p>Abstract: This paper analyses the complex challenges confronting the South African Police<br>Service (SAPS), emphasising the significant interaction among historical legacies, structural<br>problems, and current crime trends. It examines the degradation of public confidence, the<br>efficiency of accountability measures, and the influence of socioeconomic variables on policing<br>efficacy. This study highlights critical areas for change through a synthesis of previous research<br>and theoretical frameworks, including social disorganisation, institutional, and procedural<br>justice theories. It underscores the pressing necessity for more community involvement,<br>stringent supervision, and evidence-based crime prevention methodologies. The paper examines<br>the ramifications of technology progress and the increase in cybercrime, highlighting the<br>imperative for ethical and responsible application. This research offers pragmatic solutions for<br>restoring confidence, enhancing organisational capacity, and promoting a more equitable and<br>efficient SAPS, therefore leading to a safer South Africa. The objective of this comprehensive<br>literature review is to consolidate current research on the South African Police Service (SAPS),<br>emphasising the key aspects that influence its efficacy and legitimacy in a post-apartheid<br>environment. The study centres on critical subjects such as police-community interactions,<br>systemic corruption, accountability systems, resource allocation, the influence of historical<br>legacies, the effectiveness of community policing, and the incorporation of technology<br>improvements. Principal Arguments: The analysis contends that the SAPS has ongoing<br>problems arising from a confluence of historical distrust, organisational shortcomings, and<br>changing crime patterns. It underscores the imperative for extensive reforms that emphasise<br>trust-building, accountability, and evidence-based police methodologies. This research adopts a<br>systematic literature review technique, leveraging several electronic databases and grey<br>literature sources. Studies were chosen according to established inclusion and exclusion criteria,<br>and data were retrieved and synthesised by theme analysis. This analysis offers a thorough<br>synthesis of existing research, highlighting critical gaps and guiding evidence-based policy<br>suggestions to enhance SAPS efficacy. It emphasises the necessity of tackling structural<br>challenges to bolster public trust and enable the SAPS to execute its constitutional<br>responsibility. This evaluation targets policymakers, academics, law enforcement officials, civil<br>society organisations, and researchers focused on policing reform and security sector<br>governance in South Africa. The thorough literature assessment finds that the SAPS requires<br>substantial and ongoing modifications to tackle its complex difficulties. Emphasising<br>community involvement, enhancing accountability, and tackling socioeconomic factors<br>contributing to crime are crucial for establishing a more efficient and credible police force in<br>South Africa.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Gut microbiota plays an important role in maintaining respiratory health while providing protection against<br>respiratory illnesses. However, the clinical role of probiotic strains in prevention and treatment of early-onset<br>asthma is still debated. The present study aims to systematically review the available literature on the efficacy<br>of probiotic supplementation, either alone or in combination with other treatments, in managing children with<br>asthma. An electronic search was conducted across multiple databases including PubMed, Web of Science, and<br>EMBASE. The articles reported in English, regardless of year of publication, were reviewed by independent<br>authors for inclusion assessment. Randomized controlled studies evaluating the efficacy of probiotics in children<br>with asthma were included in the study. Of the 203 articles reviewed, 16 were selected and summarized to<br>provide a consistent review, and of these, eight studies reported the anti-asthmatic effects of the treatment with<br>single and multi-strain probiotics alone, seven reported the use of probiotic strains in combination with other<br>treatments, and one was a follow-up study. While some of the studies reported are well conducted and with<br>promising results, no cumulative significant impact was seen for probiotic supplementation on disease parameters<br>of asthma in children. However, the available literature is not sufficient to draw any solid conclusion about<br>the possible use of probiotics in children with asthma, and it is necessary to expand this literature by conducting&nbsp;</p>\n<p>more well-designed randomized clinical trials to assess the effects of probiotic strains in children with asthma or<br>carrying a high-risk of asthma.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Although herbicides are essential for global agriculture and controlling weeds, they impact&nbsp;soil microbial communities and CO2 emissions. However, the effects of herbicides, tillage systems,&nbsp;and nitrogen fertilisation on CO2 emissions under different environmental conditions are poorly&nbsp;understood. This review explores how various agricultural practices and inputs affect CO2 emissions&nbsp;and addresses the impact of pest-management strategies, tillage systems, and nitrogen fertiliser&nbsp;usage on CO2 emissions using multiple databases. Key findings indicate that both increased and&nbsp;decreased tendencies in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were observed, depending on the herbicide&nbsp;type, dose, soil properties, and application methods. Several studies reported a positive correlation&nbsp;between CO2 emissions and increased agricultural production. Combining herbicides with other&nbsp;methods effectively controls emissions with minimal chemical inputs. Conservation practices like&nbsp;no-tillage were more effective than conventional tillage in mitigating carbon emissions. Integrated&nbsp;pest management, conservation tillage, and nitrogen fertiliser rate optimisation were shown to reduce&nbsp;herbicide use and soil greenhouse gas emissions. Fertilisers are similarly important; depending on&nbsp;the dosage, they may support yield or harm the soil. Fertiliser benefits are contingent on appropriate&nbsp;management practices for specific soil and field conditions. This review highlights the significance of&nbsp;adaptable management strategies that consider local environmental conditions and can guide future&nbsp;studies and inform policies to promote sustainable agriculture practices worldwide.&nbsp;</p>",

        "description": "<p>\n    In the field of Earth System Science, the comprehensive understanding of\n    complex spatio-temporal environmental processes and the prediction of future\n    trends rely heavily on careful data collection, analysis, and\n    interpretation. And in particular time series data from sensor systems play a \n    central role in revealing patterns, identifying changes, evaluating model systems \n    and, ultimately, guiding decision making in various environmental domains. But\n    despite the availability of dedicated time series databases to support the development \n    of time series management systems, it has been recognized that also\n    the collection, management, and provision of associated sensor metadata is crucial \n    for ensuring sensor data usability and interpretability. \n</p>\n\n<p>\n    In this context, the four Helmholtz Centers UFZ, GFZ, FZJ, and KIT from the Research \n    Field <a href=\"https://www.helmholtz.de/en/research/research-fields/earth-and-environment/\">Earth and Environment</a> jointly develop a dedicated open-source platform for enabling \n    a FAIR and consistent management of such precious sensor metadata - the so-called Sensor\n    Management System (SMS). This system supports scientists and technicians in the \n    harmonized and user-friendly management of sensors, measurement setups, and campaigns. \n    It features a modern and user-friendly interface coupled with a robust JSON:API \n    and supports the OGC SensorML standard for data exchange. It includes an OAuth-based \n    authentication system using the Helmholtz AAI, complemented by a sophisticated rights \n    management structure. Sensor attributes within SMS adhere to a unified metadata catalog \n    that includes mandatory, optional, and user-specific attributes. The SMS provides \n    traceability and provenance tracking. Interfaces to handle systems such as B2INST allow \n    persistent identifiers to be generated.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    The SMS is being developed as part of the <a href=\"https://earth-data.de\">DataHub</a>, \n    an initiative that implements a uniform and FAIR research data infrastructure across the \n    seven Helmholtz Centers of the Research Field Earth and Environment. \n</p>\n\n<p>\n    Presently operational at GFZ\n    (<a href=\"https://sensors.gfz-potsdam.de\">https://sensors.gfz-potsdam.de</a>),\n    UFZ\n    (<a href=\"https://web.app.ufz.de/sms\">https://web.app.ufz.de/sms/</a>),\n    FZJ\n    (<a href=\"https://sms.earth-data.fz-juelich.de\">https://sms.earth-data.fz-juelich.de/</a>),\n    and KIT\n    (<a href=\"https://sms.atmohub.kit.edu\">https://sms.atmohub.kit.edu/</a>),\n    the Sensor Management System provides a decentralized solution.\n    For those choosing self-hosting, comprehensive documentation is available\n    (<a href=\"https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.14372/SMS-Readme\">https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.14372/SMS-Readme</a>).\n    Users seeking guidance on system navigation and features can refer to the WIKI\n    (<a href=\"https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.14372/SMS-Wiki\">https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.14372/SMS-Wiki</a>)\n    for a user-centric guide and valuable insights into seamless utilization.\n</p>",

        "description": "<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The heritage science sector is facing a critical need for accessible and comprehensive data resources to facilitate research, preservation efforts, and interdisciplinary collaboration. The concept of FAIR data management involves embracing principles and practices that ensure that data are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. This work presents an overview of the latest updates on the INFRA-ART Spectral Library, an open access spectral database of cultural-heritage-related materials that was designed as a digital support tool for heritage research specialists that work with (portable) non- or minimally invasive spectroscopic techniques such as X-ray fluorescence (XRF), attenuated total reflectance&ndash;Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, or Raman spectroscopy, among others. The database is an ongoing compilation of high-quality curated data that currently incorporates primary ATR-FTIR and XRF spectra and a preliminary dataset of Raman and short-wave infrared (SWIR) reflectance spectra on over 900 different materials typically found in painted works of art. For increased and sustainable accessibility, the database follows the European Commission&rsquo;s recommendations on access to scientific information, as well as the FAIR guiding principles on research data that result from publicly funded research. The INFRA-ART Spectral Library is registered as a resource within the Open Science Cloud (EOSC) Portal and is among the services offered by the Romanian hub within E-RIHS (European Research Infrastructure for Heritage Science) DIGILAB.</p>",
