It is outlined that effective tools for<br>the development and functioning of business structures in conditions of sustainable development are<br>management functions, namely analytical, forecasting, and system planning. It was noted that one of<br>the important effective tools for the development and functioning of business structures in today&rsquo;s<br>conditions is GR&ndash;management in the formation of the management of an industrial enterprise. GR<br>(Government Relations) is outlined as the formation of relations of enterprises with power structures<br>and one of the components of their management.<br>Purpose of the study. It was noted that the essence of such a strategic partnership is long&ndash;term<br>cooperation between enterprises, the state and institutions of higher education in the context of a synergistic<br>effect. The methods, tools of GR technology and the main stages of GR management are outlined.<br>Research methods. When writing a scientific article, general scientific and special research<br>methods were used: description, analysis, generalization, and systematization.<br>Work results. The historical chronology of GR as a type of activity was studied. The peculiarities of<br>GR&ndash;management were noted in this study. The economic essence of the concepts of communication<br>management, PR, and lobbying is singled out and defined. Scientific approaches to the interpretation and understanding of the problem of communication management are defined. Concepts such as<br>GR and PR are distinguished, GR and PR are defined as the most important blocks of enterprise<br>communication management, which have different objects of managerial influence.<br>Conclusion. The subject, object, subject and main tasks of PR management are defined. It was noted<br>that combining the services of GR&ndash;management and PR&ndash;management will have a favorable effect on<br>the formation of relations between the government and business. As a conclusion, it is proven that the<br>formation of open, positive, reliable partnership relations using a large number of tools is the direct<br>purpose of GR&ndash;management of an industrial enterprise.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The subject of the study is the parsing of contradictions and anti&ndash;dumping measures regarding<br>subsidies to agricultural enterprises against WTO legislation.<br>The purpose of the study is to determine the features and tools for considering contradictions<br>and anti&ndash;dumping measures regarding subsidies to agricultural enterprises against WTO legislation.</p>\n<p>Research methods. The article uses the dialectical method of scientific knowledge, the method of<br>analysis and synthesis, the comparative method, and the method of data generalization.<br>Results of the work. The article analyzes the contradictions that arise when applying anti&ndash;<br>dumping and countervailing measures to agricultural products that receive state subsidies, from the<br>point of view of compliance with the norms of the World Trade Organization (WTO). It is studied how<br>national legislation aimed at protecting the domestic market from dumped imports clashes with WTO<br>rules on subsidizing agriculture. Special attention is paid to the classification of subsidies (green box,<br>yellow box, blue box) and their impact on the possibility of applying anti&ndash;dumping duties. Cases are<br>analyzed when anti&ndash;dumping measures actually eliminate WTO&ndash;allowed subsidies, creating unequal<br>conditions of competition, and ways to resolve these contradictions are considered.<br>The purpose of the study is to determine ways to ensure fair trade in agricultural products and<br>avoid abuse of anti&ndash;dumping measures.<br>Conclusions. Anti&ndash;dumping and countervailing measures applied to agricultural enterprises cause<br>significant controversy in the context of WTO law. Subsidies to the agricultural sector, common in<br>many countries, often become the subject of anti&ndash;dumping investigations and countervailing duties.<br>The problem lies in the complexity of determining a &laquo;fair&raquo; price and proving the fact of dumping or<br>the presence of harmful subsidies. WTO agreements contain positions that allow the application of<br>such measures, but their interpretation and application often cause disagreements. Controversies<br>arise around the methods of calculating the dumping margin and the volume of subsidies, as well<br>as determining the cause and effect link between imports and the injury caused to local producers.<br>Opacity in the application of methodologies and political pressure can lead to the abuse of these<br>instruments, violating the principles of free trade defined in the WTO. Resolving these contradictions<br>requires increased transparency and the development of clear, internationally agreed rules.</p>",

The study covers the analysis of theoretical<br>foundations of strategic management used to shape innovative strategies, as well as the assessment<br>of their practical implementation in construction. Factors influencing strategic decision&ndash;making in<br>construction projects are considered, including technological, economic, regulatory, and social aspects.<br>Special attention is paid to analyzing the impact of strategic innovations on key stakeholder groups,<br>including investors, developers, government authorities, and end&ndash;users of construction projects. The study aims to determine optimal approaches to integrating strategic management into the decision&ndash;<br>making process regarding the adoption of innovations in construction.<br>The purpose of the article is to define and analyze the impact of current strategic management<br>concepts on the process of selecting strategic innovations in construction projects and their<br>significance for stakeholders. The study aims to assess the effectiveness of applying modern strategic<br>approaches to managing innovation processes in the construction sector. Special attention is paid<br>to exploring mechanisms for integrating strategic management into decision&ndash;making regarding<br>innovations in construction, considering economic, technological, and social factors. The possibilities<br>of optimizing strategic management to enhance the competitiveness of construction projects and<br>their adaptation to modern market conditions are examined.<br>The methodology of the study is based on a systematic approach to analyzing the impact of current<br>strategic management concepts on the choice of strategic innovations in construction projects. The<br>research relies on structural analysis methods, allowing the identification of interconnections between<br>management strategies and innovation implementation processes in the construction industry. A<br>comparative analysis method is used to assess the effectiveness of various strategic management<br>concepts and their adaptation to the specifics of construction projects. The analytical method is applied<br>to study practical aspects of implementing strategic innovations and their impact on stakeholders,<br>including investors, regulatory bodies, contractors, and end&ndash;users. The expert assessment method is<br>used to obtain generalized conclusions on the effectiveness of applying modern strategic approaches<br>to construction project management. The analysis of empirical data is conducted based on the<br>study of real construction projects implementing innovative strategies to determine key factors<br>influencing their success. The forecasting method is applied to assess the potential development of<br>strategic innovations in the construction sector, considering global market trends and changes in<br>the regulatory environment. The study employs both quantitative and qualitative analysis methods<br>to evaluate the dynamics of strategic innovation implementation in construction and their impact on<br>the long&ndash;term competitiveness of the sector. Additionally, content analysis of scientific publications<br>on strategic management in construction is applied, along with statistical methods to assess the<br>effectiveness indicators of strategic innovations. The comprehensive approach ensures the objectivity<br>of the obtained results and allows for the identification of optimal approaches to integrating strategic<br>management into the decision&ndash;making process for selecting innovations in construction projects.<br>The results of the study indicate a significant impact of modern strategic management<br>concepts on the choice of strategic innovations in construction projects. The analysis has shown that<br>effective application of strategic management contributes to optimizing decision&ndash;making processes<br>regarding innovations and improving their efficiency. It has been found that the integration of strategic<br>approaches reduces the risks of innovation implementation, ensures compliance with the economic<br>and technological conditions of the industry, and enhances the overall competitiveness of construction<br>projects. The success of strategic innovations largely depends on considering the interests of key<br>stakeholders, such as investors, contractors, regulatory authorities, and end&ndash;users. An analysis of<br>international experience has demonstrated that the most effective approaches combine strategic<br>planning, risk management, and digitalization of construction processes. Recommendations have<br>been proposed for adapting strategic management in construction projects, including improving<br>forecasting of external environmental changes and expanding strategic analysis tools. The study<br>confirms the necessity of developing long&ndash;term strategies for the construction industry, taking into<br>account the impact of innovative solutions.<br>The conclusions of the study confirm the significant influence of current strategic management<br>concepts on the selection of strategic innovations in construction projects. The results of the analysis<br>indicate that effective innovation management in construction is possible only with the comprehensive<br>application of strategic approaches that consider technological, economic, and social factors. Strategic<br>innovations contribute to increasing the efficiency of construction projects, reducing risks, and<br>optimizing costs, which are key aspects for stakeholders, including investors, regulatory authorities,<br>contractors, and end&ndash;users. The study confirms that integrating modern strategic management \u0430\u043amethods<br>into construction projects enables adaptation to dynamic market changes, enhances<br>competitiveness, and ensures the long&ndash;term sustainability of the industry. The implementation<br>of digital technologies, risk management, and strategic planning are key factors for the successful<br>selection and realization of innovative solutions. The obtained results highlight the need for further<br>research in the field of strategic innovation management in construction to develop effective models<br>for their integration and improve decision&ndash;making mechanisms.</p>",

Government education programs play a pivotal role in fostering gender equality, addressing disparities, and equipping women with the knowledge and skills necessary to improve their lives. This study explores the impact of various government education initiatives on women's empowerment, focusing on the changes they bring in women&rsquo;s access to education, economic opportunities, and social status. Through an analysis of specific government-led programs, such as scholarships, literacy campaigns, vocational training, and gender-sensitive curricula, the research aims to assess the effectiveness of these initiatives in reducing gender gaps in education and enhancing women's autonomy. The paper further examines the challenges faced by these programs, including cultural barriers, gender stereotypes, and inadequate resources. By exploring studies from different regions, this study highlights the correlation between government interventions in education and measurable improvements in women&rsquo;s empowerment, with a particular emphasis on economic participation, political engagement, and health outcomes. Ultimately, this research emphasizes the need for continued policy innovation and investment in education as a means to ensure lasting empowerment for women in diverse socio-economic contexts.</em></p>\n<p><em>&nbsp;The present paper focused on the study the Impact of Government Education Programs in Women&rsquo;s Empowerment with prime objectives are (i) To understand the Concept of Women Empowerment and Connection Between SDG 5 and Women Empowerment.(ii) To discuss the Government Education programs on Women Empowerment.

        "description": "<p>The subject of the study is the process of formation and evolution of the content of strategic<br>innovations in construction companies through the integrated lens of SMART management and<br>sustainable development principles. Special attention is given to defining the essence of strategic<br>innovations in the construction sector, their conceptual framework, and transformation mechanisms in<br>response to contemporary challenges. The study analyzes the role of SMART management as a systemic<br>approach to managing innovation activities, based on specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and<br>time&ndash;bound goals. It explores how the principles of sustainable development&mdash;particularly environmental,<br>economic, and social balance&mdash;impact the formation of strategic innovation solutions. The research aims<br>to establish a link between the effectiveness of construction company management, their adaptability,<br>and their ability to implement innovations in the context of long&ndash;term sustainability and competitiveness.<br>The objective of the article is to substantiate the theoretical foundations and develop conceptual<br>approaches to the formation and evolution of the content of strategic innovations in construction<br>companies, considering the integration of SMART management and sustainable development<br>principles. The study focuses on identifying key factors influencing the transformation of innovation<br>strategies and revealing mechanisms for construction enterprises to adapt to a dynamic market<br>environment. Special attention is paid to the role of modern management approaches in ensuring<br>the long&ndash;term sustainability and competitiveness of the industry through the implementation of<br>environmentally, socially, and economically justified innovative solutions.<br>The methodology of the study is based on systemic, comprehensive, and interdisciplinary approaches,<br>which allow for examining the process of formation and evolution of strategic innovations in construction<br>companies through the integration of SMART management principles and sustainable development.</p>\n<p>The work is grounded in the analysis of theoretical foundations of strategic innovation management,<br>particularly through the study of scholarly works, regulations, and international standards that govern<br>innovation development in the construction sector. To identify trends and patterns in the development<br>of strategic innovations, the comparative analysis method is employed, which allows for evaluating the<br>effectiveness of innovation implementation approaches in various companies and countries.<br>For a deeper understanding of innovation management mechanisms, a structural&ndash;functional approach<br>is used, which enables the identification of the interconnection between SMART management tools and the<br>implementation of innovations in the construction sector.

        "description": "<p>The subject of this study is the assessment of the investment climate in the construction sector,<br>the identification of key challenges and institutional factors influencing the processes of managing<br>strategic transformations of construction enterprises&ndash;stakeholders. The research examines economic,<br>regulatory, and social aspects that determine the attractiveness of investments in the construction<br>sector, as well as the factors that either constrain or stimulate the long&ndash;term development of the<br>industry. Special attention is paid to the analysis of the institutional environment, covering government<br>policies, legal mechanisms, financial support, and international regulatory standards.<br>The study also explores stakeholder interactions, including investors, government authorities,<br>construction companies, financial institutions, and public organizations. It has been established that<br>effective management of investment flows and strategic transformations is possible only under a<br>balanced market regulation approach, stimulation of innovative strategies, and the use of analytical<br>tools for forecasting market changes.<br>The purpose of this study is to analyze the investment climate and define the methodological<br>foundations for managing the strategic transformations of construction enterprises while considering<br>institutional factors and market challenges. The main focus is on developing approaches to assessing<br>the level of investment attractiveness in the construction sector, identifying barriers to development,<br>and formulating recommendations to improve the efficiency of investment attraction.<br>The study examines key macroeconomic and microeconomic factors affecting the strategic planning<br>of construction enterprises and their adaptation to new market conditions. An analytical approach to<br>modeling transformational processes is proposed, which allows evaluating the effectiveness of change<br>management, optimizing investment strategies, and enhancing the competitiveness of construction<br>companies in the long&ndash;term perspective.<br>The research methodology is based on systemic and structural&ndash;functional approaches, which<br>allow for the assessment of the interrelationship between institutional factors, investment climate, and<br>mechanisms of strategic transformations in construction enterprises. Within the study, an analysis<br>of the investment environment was conducted using comparative analysis methods and economic&ndash;statistical modeling. Key indicators such as the level of foreign direct investment, construction market<br>dynamics, regulatory changes, and the innovation potential of enterprises were evaluated, enabling<br>the identification of major trends and challenges for the industry.<br>A crucial stage of the study involved identifying the key challenges and risks affecting the<br>development of the construction sector. For this purpose, a SWOT analysis method was applied,<br>allowing for an evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the sector, potential opportunities, and<br>threats posed by the macroeconomic environment. This was supplemented by expert assessment<br>methods, which helped highlight the most pressing issues that hamper investment activity and reduce<br>the effectiveness of strategic transformations.<br>One of the key directions of the research was the examination of institutional factors influencing the<br>investment climate in the construction sector. In this context, a comparative analysis of legal mechanisms<br>governing investment conditions was carried out. The study considered tax incentives, investment<br>benefits, state support programs, and compliance with international market regulation standards.<br>The analysis of strategic transformations in enterprises was conducted using scenario forecasting,<br>econometric analysis, and structural modeling methods. Various approaches to optimizing business<br>models, digital transformation, improving resource efficiency, and implementing innovations were explored,<br>providing a comprehensive view of enterprise adaptation mechanisms in dynamic market conditions.<br>Based on the obtained results, recommendations for improving the investment climate were<br>developed, focusing on an investment management model that considers market challenges and<br>regulatory specifics. Mechanisms for enhancing the institutional environment were identified,<br>aimed at increasing market transparency, reducing investment risks, and stimulating the strategic<br>development of stakeholder enterprises.<br>Thus, the research methodology not only facilitates the identification of optimal investment attraction<br>strategies but also enhances risk management efficiency and contributes to the development of scientifically<br>grounded approaches for implementing strategic transformations in the construction industry.<br>Research Results. The study analyzed institutional factors that determine the investment climate<br>and strategic transformations of construction enterprises. It was established that the effectiveness<br>of strategic change management in the construction industry largely depends on the regulatory<br>environment, economic stability, state investment policies, and the innovation activity of enterprises.<br>A comprehensive analysis of macro&ndash; and microeconomic indicators was conducted, allowing for an<br>assessment of the key challenges affecting the development of the construction sector, including<br>barriers to attracting investment and factors contributing to the stable growth of the industry.<br>The research confirmed the importance of strategic approaches to change management, particularly<br>through the implementation of digital technologies, process automation, and modernization of<br>management mechanisms. The analysis of the institutional environment demonstrated that the<br>legal regulatory framework, tax incentives, access to financial resources, and government support<br>measures significantly impact the level of investment activity in the sector.<br>A model for investment management was developed, taking into account market challenges and<br>regulatory specifics, enabling enterprises to adapt to shifts in market conditions. Additionally, the<br>study confirmed the effectiveness of econometric analysis and scenario forecasting in evaluating the<br>long&ndash;term sustainability of enterprises.<br>The proposed recommendations are aimed at enhancing the transparency of the construction<br>market, optimizing investment processes, and creating favorable conditions for the strategic<br>development of enterprises.<br>Conclusions. The conducted study confirmed that strategic transformations of construction<br>enterprises depend on the quality of the investment climate, the efficiency of institutional regulation,<br>and the ability to adapt to modern economic challenges. Institutional factors, including legal regulations,<br>financial policies, and international standards, play a key role in determining inve Significant attention was given to the need for an integrated system of investment flow management,<br>which would allow more efficient resource utilization, risk minimization, and stable enterprise growth.<br>A crucial role in this process is played by digital technologies, which contribute to process automation,<br>improved analytics, and increased transparency in investment activities.<br>The study demonstrated that optimizing management strategies in the construction industry is<br>possible if both internal and external factors influencing market dynamics are taken into account.<br>The successful implementation of strategic transformations requires active cooperation between<br>the state, investors, enterprises, and financial institutions, which would contribute to enhancing the<br>sector&rsquo;s investment attractiveness.<br>Thus, the study confirms the necessity of a comprehensive approach to managing strategic<br>transformations, which includes the use of innovative models, digital tools, and adaptive management<br>strategies. The proposed approaches and recommendations can serve as a foundation for the<br>development of new mechanisms aimed at increasing the competitiveness of construction enterprises<br>in the long&ndash;term perspective.</p>",

        "description": "<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-IN\">Abstract:</span></strong></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-IN\">In today's era of complex financial crimes, forensic accounting is essential for detecting and preventing fraud. Traditional methods struggle with growing data volumes and sophisticated fraud tactics, making AI integration a game-changer. AI-powered tools like machine learning, natural language processing, and predictive analytics enhance forensic accounting by automating data analysis, identifying patterns, and detecting anomalies missed by traditional methods. These technologies enable faster, more accurate investigations, helping forensic accountants focus on high-risk areas, minimize financial losses, and strengthen regulatory compliance. AI improves efficiency by detecting fraud earlier, assessing risks more effectively, and streamlining reporting while automating repetitive tasks. Additionally, AI predicts potential fraud risks based on historical data, allowing proactive measures. However, challenges such as data privacy, ethical concerns, and over-reliance on automation must be addressed to ensure transparency and accountability. This research explores AI's role in forensic accounting, highlighting its potential to revolutionize the field and enhance financial security.</span></p>",
