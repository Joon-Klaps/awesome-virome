        "description": "<p>The digiNEB.eu project successfully created a platform for transferring innovation best practices in&nbsp;support of the New European Bauhaus (NEB) initiative. Over its duration, the project showed that&nbsp;digital technologies can support the transition towards sustainable, inclusive, and aesthetically&nbsp;enriched living spaces, aligning with the European Green Deal's ambitions. Through a combination of&nbsp;mapping, stakeholder engagement, capacity-building, and knowledge dissemination, digiNEB.eu has&nbsp;delivered concrete results that have an impact across Europe. The key achievements of digiNEB are:</p>\n<p><strong>Mapping and Showcasing Digital Solutions and Projects</strong></p>\n<p>digiNEB.eu successfully mapped NEB-related projects and curated a Digital Toolkit comprising&nbsp;innovative digital solutions aligning with the NEB values. These tools and services provide stakeholders&nbsp;with practical, accessible resources to address NEB challenges. By combining innovations in the built&nbsp;environment into a comprehensive online toolkit of tools, projects and actors, digiNEB.eu connected&nbsp;research outcomes and real-world applications, empowering users to implement solutions that&nbsp;enhance sustainability, inclusivity, and aesthetic quality in European living environments.</p>\n<p><strong>Building a Pan-European Network</strong></p>\n<p>The project cultivated a vibrant, cross-disciplinary community of stakeholders, representing a diverse&nbsp;array of actors, including architects, designers, SMEs, policymakers, and civil society organisations.</p>\n<p>This network has been instrumental in promoting the best practices identified by the project. Through&nbsp;the Technical Working Groups (TWGs) and the External Advisory Group (EAG), digiNEB.eu fostered&nbsp;meaningful collaboration and knowledge-sharing across sectors and guided the development of&nbsp;strategies for transferring innovative solutions to diverse contexts.</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity Building and Knowledge Transfer</strong></p>\n<p>digiNEB.eu successfully conducted 16 multi-stakeholder workshops and 6 webinars, bringing together&nbsp;professionals, innovators, educators and policy actors to exchange knowledge and explore best&nbsp;practices. These events facilitated learning, networking and the transfer of innovation across the NEB&nbsp;community. To facilitate knowledge transfer, digiNEB-eu set up an e-learning catalogue of online&nbsp;courses aligning with the NEB values. digiNEB cooperates with the development of an eLearning&nbsp;platform feeding the NEBA project facilitating the platform&rsquo;s long-term sustainability. In this way,&nbsp;digiNEB leverages the knowledge of the digital ecosystem, the pan-European network and knowledge&nbsp;building towards creating a platform for capacity building.</p>\n<p><strong>Showcasing Best Practices</strong></p>\n<p>The project culminated in the open-access publication of Deliverable 3.3, a comprehensive resource&nbsp;that captures the transfer of innovation best practices throughout the project. This publication&nbsp;showcases the activities performed to strengthen the pan-European capacity building connecting&nbsp;regions, communities and actors through a multi-layered multi-stakeholder approach. These activities&nbsp;focused on collectively sharing innovations applied to real-world NEB challenges, offering replicable&nbsp;solutions for stakeholders across Europe. Events featured in the publication highlight concrete&nbsp;examples of innovative projects, tools and actors that have shown best practices in line with the NEB&nbsp;values.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>The digiNEB.eu project has delivered significant and lasting contributions in transferring innovation&nbsp;best practices across Europe. By fostering a multi-layered, multi-stakeholder collaborative and crossdisciplinary&nbsp;network and providing access to tools, projects and actors that are successfully paving the&nbsp;way, digiNEB.eu has empowered stakeholders to actively engage with the NEB community. The&nbsp;project's outputs, from the Digital Toolkit, the online platform or the policy recommendations, ensure&nbsp;that digital innovation will continue to drive the transformation of European living spaces, making&nbsp;them more sustainable, inclusive, and beautiful for generations to come.</p>",

        "description": "<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>The infiltration of Western civilization into African societies has resulted in the loss of interest in the once-cherished African culture and tradition. Africans, especially the elites, have joined the so-called civilized world to see the pristine African tradition and culture as crude and barbaric following the Western education and civilization they have acquired. Furthermore, as a result of religions that were foreign to Africa which Africans have come to embrace, most African elites have dissociated themselves from certain traditional spiritual symbols and activities which are Indigenous to them. Festival, which is an annual event that celebrates an aspect of community, such as its tradition, art or religion has proven a strong medium of revamping the lost interest in African tradition, culture, and arts. The paper looks at how African tradition and culture are now being rebranded and passed to new generations at home and abroad through festivals with particular reference to the <em>Madawa </em>festival. <em>Madawa </em>festival is a special annual festival celebrated by the Gbagyi people of Bosso Local Government in Niger State. <em>Madawa </em>is commemorated mainly but not exclusively to neutralize any possible afflictions hunters may suffer as a result of the game they kill. The festival attracts people from all works of life, far and near. The paper argues that there is a renewed interest in African tradition and culture by both the traditionalists and elites as all strive to identify themselves with the tradition and culture of the people during a festival. Festivals have therefore sustained African tradition and culture thereby saving them from total extinction. The paper is therefore an attempt to examine festivals as the core channels and of course, the most vibrant medium that practically conveys African tradition and culture from one generation to another. The functionalist approach to literature will be adopted to appraise the <em>Madawa </em>Festival to establish the role of the festival as a medium of cultural revival. The paper recommends that rather than seeing festivals as a mere funfair they should be taken seriously. Any language or ethnic group that faces extinction of its tradition&nbsp; and culture should consider organizing a festival of cultural revival.<br><br></p>\n<p><strong>Takaitawa: </strong>Shigar wayewar yemmacin duniya acikin al'umomin Africa ya haifar da asarar al'adunAfrica wanda a da ake alfahari dasu.

        "description": "<p>Medical tourism can be defined as the travel of patients from one country to another with the intention of receiving medical treatment. This is an increasing and important feature of modern-day healthcare. Indeed, these latter years have seen spectacular evolution in the relationship between the two fields, health and tourism, as they merge to offer unforgettable experiences for those needing medical attention abroad. This extended essay, therefore, attempts to give wide-ranging information about this marvelous phenomenon by de-mystifying the various characteristics and its very nature imbedded in the grand context of Thai society, which has emerged as a veritable hotbed for medical tourism. Thailand, with its rich cultural heritage and salubrious landscapes, has gradually carved a niche for itself as one of the leading destinations in the international medical tourism market. This is due to various key elements contributing to the success of this industry inside the country that make it an ideal destination when considering quality medical treatment. Probably one of the significant and most specified reasons behind Thailand's medical tourism is its unparalleled affordability, ensuring that patients throughout the world get the best possible medical services for a fraction of the cost they would have incurred if the same services were offered in their home countries. Additionally, the excellent quality of services that healthcare institutions in Thailand provide also forms a strong basis for patient attraction from far and wide. It includes institutions that uphold the best standards of care in medicine, have state-of-the-art technologies and treatment methodologies for the best results on patients, and have very effective marketing strategies that work towards enhancing their reach. Thus, they have gained global recognition for their excellence not only in medical services but also in patient care. The supportive government policy promotion of the medical tourism industry was also important in determining Thailand as a health travel destination. Unreserved support by the government and commitment to the industry ensured an enabling environment that saw health providers pass unparalleled services to international patients. Furthermore, the partnership developed by the government with private operators and other stakeholders has translated into lasting relationships that ensure further success of medical tourism in Thailand. Besides the good quality medical services, the attractions that Thailand is associated with as a tourist destination further add value to visiting by medical tourists. This could be the most exciting destination in Thailand, as it combines medical treatments with vacations for complete relaxation and rejuvenation. Everything-from beautiful beaches and natural wonders to vibrant cultural experiences-offers enough variety to complement medical tourists' overall journeys with experiences and memories. Most importantly, easy accessibility to Thailand acts as a strong contributing factor towards its recognition as a hub for medical tourism. This country has very well-connected international airports and proper transportation connectivity internally. Because of this, patients face no problems reaching their concerned medical facilities with ease. Seamless entry into Thailand further facilitates medical travel, ensuring the process is smooth and hassle-free for the patients right from the moment of arrival in the country. However, this is not the sole factor responsible for such a huge popularity of Thailand as a healthcare destination. It is the emerging new trends of this medical tourism industry that sustain this factor to a large extent. The country has been prompt enough in adopting these emerging trends to enhance infrastructure continuously and offer advance and specialized medical treatments with due regard to the requirements and expectations of the patients. This proactive approach enables Thailand to stay ahead in the race in the medical tourism industry while it goes on with continuous development and raising the standards. Furthermore, much reliance on word-of-mouth publicity is what contributes heavily to Thailand's continued success in the medical tourism sector. Patients who have had positive experiences in Thai health facilities are so eager to share their stories of experiences and recommendations and act as brand ambassadors for the country's superior medical services. It is this organic promotion that helps place Thailand in a strategic position in the global medical tourism market, with an ever-increasing influx of patients seeking top-notch healthcare across borders. The increased expectations of patients and the need to transition to more preventive and wellness services are clear for healthcare providers in Thailand. This, therefore, has made these providers reorient their services toward integrated and holistic care with a view of focusing on the immediate needs of the treatment but also the total well-being of the patient. The preventive healthcare measures, promotion of healthy lifestyles, and incorporation of wellness into their service offerings are all part of how Thai healthcare providers take a holistic, patient-centered approach to medical tourism. Service providers in the industrial competitive landscape of healthcare in Thailand continue to work out the challenge of maintaining high standards of quality and pursuing continuous improvement. Excellence in medical treatment and care for the patient with overall service provided must be abreast of all times in this fast-moving dynamic industry. Continuous development in services builds a niche that sets them apart from their competitors and cements their position as a favorite among medical tourists emanating from all parts of the world. This would, therefore, suggest that the developing phenomenon of medical tourism has established itself as a transformative force within healthcare, somewhat muddying the boundaries between health and tourism. Reasonably priced, superior quality of service, strategically marketed, liberal government policies, incomparable resort destinations, easy to reach, strong public-private partnership, new trends, friendly entry processes, world-class infrastructure, and above all, depending heavily on word-of-mouth advertising, Thailand has no doubt created a niche for itself as a leading global player in this medical tourism sector. The providers are clearly working their way up the ladder in providing comprehensive and patient-centered services, as they understand the shift in the expectations of patients from healthcare and the emphasis on preventive and wellness services. These providers are operating amid competitors, working further for excellence, setting higher standards of quality, and contributing to the continued success of medical tourism in Thailand.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This review article presents a literature review and analytical evaluation of research conducted in the field of folklore in K\u0131r\u015fehir and its surroundings. Its primary purpose is to provide recommendations to promote the transmission and preservation of the region's rich cultural heritage from a folklore perspective. The study meticulously examines the oral culture elements, folk literature, rituals, and traditional practices of the region and emphasizes their importance in cultural continuity. By addressing the current state of folklore research in K\u0131r\u015fehir and its surroundings, the study aims to make a meaningful contribution to the knowledge in this field simultaneously. K\u0131r\u015fehir region is essential in Turkish folklore due to its unique cultural elements. Among these, the Abdal tradition and cultural icons such as Ne\u015fet Erta\u015f are particularly noteworthy. Folk narratives and the themes explored further enrich the region's cultural texture. Related studies have explored various folklore elements of the region, including folk music, rites of passage, minstrelsy traditions, and children's games. These elements reveal a multi-layered cultural structure that reflects the depth and complexity of K\u0131r\u015fehir's heritage.</p>\n<p>Children's games are another critical area of focus in the study. These games are not just recreational activities but also vital in cultural transmission. These games contribute to the region's social cohesion by strengthening social bonds and facilitating interaction between children. By examining the structure and themes of these games, the study sheds light on their importance in preserving cultural values and transmitting them to the future.</p>\n<p>The study also emphasizes the role of rites of passage associated with birth, marriage, and death. These rituals are deeply embedded in the cultural fabric of K\u0131r\u015fehir and reflect the society's values, beliefs, and traditions. By documenting and analyzing these practices, the study offers insights into how such rituals contribute to the cultural continuity of the region. The impact of the Ahi tradition on K\u0131r\u015fehir culture is another important issue discussed in the study. The Ahi tradition, based on the principles of brotherhood, ethics, and solidarity, has played an essential role in shaping the social and economic structure of the region. The historical contributions of Ahi Evran, a central figure of this tradition, are discussed in detail.</p>\n<p>The study also addresses the challenges and limitations of folklore research in the region. It acknowledges that the scope of the research is limited to existing literature and internet-accessible resources. Despite these limitations, the findings highlight the richness of K\u0131r\u015fehir folklore and its potential for further research. It is seen that the most comprehensively examined topics are the Abdal tradition, Ne\u015fet Erta\u015f, and the minstrel tradition and reflect the importance of these in cultural heritage. The study's findings demonstrate the critical importance of folklore in creating and maintaining cultural identity. The study documents the folkloric elements of the region and offers valuable suggestions for their preservation in modern society. These recommendations include digitizing cultural heritage, integrating folklore into educational curricula, and developing communities.</p>\n<p>Folklore studies on K\u0131r\u015fehir have mostly focused on topics such as music and minstrel tradition (Abdallar, Ne\u015fet Erta\u015f, Muharrem Erta\u015f, bozlaks, folk songs), folk literature and narratives (fairy tales, epics, legends, laments, folk poetry), rites of passage (birth, marriage, circumcision, death), traditional handicrafts and weavings (carpets, kilims, textile motifs) and folk culture and daily life (Ahi Evran, Ahilik tradition, children's games, folk beliefs).</p>\n<p>Additionally, the study reveals important insights into the multidimensional nature of K\u0131r\u015fehir's cultural heritage. Elements such as dowry traditions, storytelling techniques, and symbolic motifs in textiles are considered integral components of this heritage. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how cultural elements intertwine to form a region's identity.</p>\n<p>As a result, the study serves as a vital resource for policymakers, educators, and researchers interested in preserving cultural heritage. It emphasizes the need for proactive measures to preserve the region's folklore and ensure that it remains a vibrant and dynamic part of the community's identity. The integration of these cultural elements into modern life is presented as an essential strategy. This study beautifully demonstrates the richness of K\u0131r\u015fehir folklore and its indispensable role in shaping cultural identity. By highlighting the diversea traditions of the region, it presents a convincing argument for the importance of preserving and promoting cultural heritage in today's rapidly changing world. The study not only documents the cultural richness of K\u0131r\u015fehir but also provides a road map for future research and conservation efforts, ensuring that this invaluable heritage continues to thrive for future generations.</p>",

        "description": "<p><span>The privileged communication concept has been an anchor of evidentiary law for a long time, protecting confidential communications from compelled disclosure during legal proceedings. With the passing of the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023, India has taken a great leap forward towards updating its evidence law to fit into modern-day socio-legal realities. This article discusses the evolution of privileged communication from its colonial past to its modern-day structure under the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023. It discusses the statutory provisions regulating privileged communication, such as communications between spouses, legal practitioners and clients, state matters, and professional confidentiality. The paper discusses how the new Act weighs the importance of confidentiality within privileged relationships against the need for openness and justice in the court process. The paper also dissects the drawbacks of the cyber age, such as the ability of confidentiality to be broken via cyber weakness and the admissibility of computer records in evidence. By analysing case laws and comparative legal regimes, this paper contends that the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023, represents an important step in the direction of harmonizing India's law of evidence with international standards while tackling the country's specific socio-legal environment. The research paper emphasizes the requirement of a vibrant approach to privileged communication that combines confidentiality, openness, and justice. As India transitions away from its colonial legal legacy, the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023 is an important effort to redefine evidentiary privileges in a world of digital interactions and changing legal doctrines. The research concludes with suggestions for strengthening legal protections to make privileged communication effective and relevant in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</span></p>",

        "description": "<p>Currently, the hospitality and tourism industry in Thailand is at a state of great flux. This, therefore, calls for a highly competent and versatile workforce to deal with this situation. For this paper, we shall attempt at providing an overview of the current skill set from the current workforce involved in the hospitality and tourism industry in Thailand. We also attempt to identify the prevailing opinions of the managerial personnel on different work aspects, which include the perception of the skills that Thai workers possess. Moreover, the paper looks at what the managers would want and hope for in the future workforce, and the strategies applied to develop such skills in workers soon. This qualitative research approach is employed to dig deep into the minds of key decision makers in Thailand by way of in-depth, one-on-one, or small group interviews to document and consolidate the insights and viewpoints of distinguished executives and top-level decision makers belonging to prestigious hotel and tourism conglomerates in Thailand. The findings of our research unmistakably indicate that the hospitality industry in the country is doubtless in a growth and prosperous period, where it successfully meets various and constantly changing preferences among tourists coming for different purposes. With the tourism industry in Thailand mushrooming, it is vital to establish what has contributed to such success. With more and more people globe-trotting and with tourists pouring in droves into Thailand, the need for a skilled workforce within the hospitality industries is at an all-time high. It therefore becomes relevant during these times of change to identify the skillset of the personnel at work within this vibrant industry. Deep inside the minds of managerial professionals, we can gain a clear insight into how they perceive the current workforce. By conducting comprehensive interviews on an individual and small group basis, we hope to capture the capability and strengths of the Thai workforce with a great degree of subtlety. Second, we also attempt to find out what aspirations and expectations the managers have from the future workforce. The resulting skills and competencies will have to be identified as the industry continues to evolve, but by exploring strategies utilized to develop such skilled labor, we expose the preparations being made for the workforce of tomorrow. Our qualitative research methodology enables us to interact directly with key decision-makers in the industry. We have thus gathered much information and opinion by involving those senior executives and senior-level decision makers of reputed hotel and tourism conglomerates. Their valuable insights helped us to closely look into the current scenario and aspects which still needed to be improved. Our findings clearly revealed that the hospitality industry in Thailand is one of the fastest growing and most successful sectors. It has satisfactorily adapted to the increasing and changing tastes and preferences of the tourists coming from different parts of the world. On the other hand, innovation and high-quality service have allowed this industry to satisfactorily address the needs and desires of its guests. Conclusion Our study puts light on the change which the hospitality and tourism industry of Thailand is experiencing at present. The following sections provide a broad outline of the skillset of the workforce, based on in-depth interviews with managerial professionals. We have taken a closer look at what industry leaders expect and/or hope for in the future workforce, and how they are developing the skills necessary to meet those expectations. This research supports the notion that the hospitality industry is increasing its growth to meet the demands of a multifaceted global customer base.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region has been experiencing a vibrant economy with heavy investment in higher education as an economic development driver. Being home to over 630 million people and more than 7,000 higher education institutions (HEIs) and over 12 million students, it was critical to evaluate the role of cross-border higher education in the region. This study aimed to investigate the factors and motivations contributing to the success and efficacy of cross-border higher education in the ASEAN region. Additionally, it sought to examine the impact of cross-border education on the development of global citizenship. A quantitative study was conducted using secondary data from the repositories of the World Bank and UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS). Data was analyzed using descriptive visualizations and regression analysis. Results indicated variations in HEIs investments, with Brunei having the least. Many students moved from the ASEAN region to seek higher education in other regions, with Vietnam having the highest number of 137,022 students. The majority of these ASEAN countries have more than 10,000 higher education students&rsquo; abroad. The United States, Australia, and Japan were the significant destinies of students from the ASEAN region. Government expenditure on tertiary education, gross domestic product (GDP), tertiary school enrolment, and GDP growth rate were found to have a significant influence on cross-border higher education mobility. Policy recommendations were the development of international collaborations, cross-border partnerships, and cross-national harmonization to enhance the partnership and mobility of higher education students in the ASEAN region.</p>",
