        "description": "<p>The management of space waste has become one of the major challenges in the<br>aerospace industry, due to the increasing number of satellites, debris, and space junk<br>orbiting the Earth. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning<br>(ML) techniques, specifically neural networks based on an innovative 0/0 optimiza-<br>tion approach, can offer an effective strategy to deal with this problem efficiently<br>and sustainably. In this work, we present an in-depth review of the theoretical foun-<br>dations of these techniques, describe implementation methodologies, discuss neural<br>network architectures optimized by 0/0, and address practical applications in the<br>processing, reuse, and safe disposal of space waste. Our goal is to provide a solid<br>basis for engineers, data scientists, and researchers who wish to understand and<br>employ this approach to protect the orbital environment and improve operational<br>efficiency in space missions.</p>",

        "description": "<p><span>Terminologies and terminology services are widely employed within the National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI) domain and other related fields, particularly in the DACH region. To gain a structured understanding of how these services and terminologies are used in this context, a comprehensive requirement analysis was conducted. This analysis was part of the initialization phase of the Base4NFDI basic service Terminology Services 4 NFDI (TS4NFDI). The results of this analysis have been compiled into a detailed report which will inform the future direction of TS4NFDI.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>The primary goal of TS4NFDI is the standardization and harmonization of terminology services within the NFDI. By doing so, it aims to integrate individual solutions into a standardized, interoperable, and sustainable terminology service. This service will be embedded in the long-term infrastructure of NFDI, ensuring consistency and reusability of terminologies across different domains. The integration of the TS4NFDI services is expected to improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of terminology management and usage, facilitating cross-domain collaboration and knowledge sharing within the NFDI community.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>The requirements analysis was designed to capture the requirements of the NFDI consortia and to identify potential use cases to support the integration of terminology services into their applications. The analysis targeted three main groups: i) developers and ii) managers of web services which interact or wish to interact with terminology services and iii) users who work with terminologies or ontologies. A total of 69 participants completed the requirement survey, providing valuable insights into the current challenges and requirements for terminology services.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>This contribution will provide an overview of the survey design and structure, as well as the results of the requirements analysis. Key findings will be shared, highlighting the major needs and opportunities in the current implementation of terminologies and services. These insights will form the basis for the ongoing development and refinement of TS4NFDI services. In addition, the contribution will illustrate the practical application of these findings through a specific use case. This use case will demonstrate how a terminology service can interact with a web service to enhance access to and utilization of terminologies in a streamlined manner. It will provide concrete examples and practical insights into technical and organizational aspects of integrating terminology services into existing infrastructures, emphasizing best practices and lessons learned.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>The requirement analysis of TS4NFDI not only presents the current needs in terminology use and management but also sets the foundation for future developments that will foster efficiency, sustainability, and collaboration across research domains. By addressing these requirements, TS4NFDI aims to enhance the NFDI data infrastructure, ensuring that terminology services evolve alongside the changing needs of the research community.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>This record contains the slides of the Talk.

Ayele (a.k.a) W has never agreed to take on the role of the &ldquo;<em>Student&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>for his published works on the OSF while the so-called &ldquo;<em>web&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>took on the role of &ldquo;<em>Professor.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>Likewise, Michael A. Ayele (a.k.a) W has never agreed to take on the role of &ldquo;<em>Plaintiff&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>and/or &ldquo;<em>Defendant&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>for his published works on OSF while the so-called &ldquo;<em>web&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>took on the role of &ldquo;<em>Judge, Jury and Executioner.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>More importantly, Michael A. Ayele (a.k.a) W had started to publish some of his correspondence with agents of the U.S government on the circumstances that led up to the enactment of the Jeanne Clery Act on (or around) November 08<sup>th</sup> 1990 because of a commitment he had made that he would disseminate any and all responsive U.S government records within their possession to members of the general public and representatives of the media at no financial expense to them. <span>To the best of his ability, Michael A. Ayele (a.k.a) W has fulfilled this commitment by disseminating (at no financial expense to representatives of the media and members of the general public) the most pertinent records on the circumstances that led up to the enactment of the Jeanne Clery Act including but not limited to his correspondence with the United States Department of Education (DoED) as well as the decision of the DoED to withhold many hundreds of pages of documents about Jeanne Clery&rsquo;s time as an undergraduate student of Lehigh University between August 1985 and April 1986 during their processing of the FOIA request they had assigned Case Number.: 21 &ndash; 00103 - F. <br><strong><br></strong>Via email dated January 05<sup>th </sup><span>&nbsp;</span>2024, Michael A. Ayele (a.k.a) W had informed representatives of OSF that the filtering and distortion of journal articles published on their platform encourages representatives of the media, members of the general public as well as independent scholars to engage in self-censorship for fear of having their content deliberately misrepresented on ISE such as AOL, Bing/MSN and Yahoo! On that same day, (January 05<sup>th</sup> 2024), Michael had also inquired if OSF were able to prevent the filtering and distortion of journal articles published on their platforms on ISE such as AOL, Bing/MSN and Yahoo! On (or around) January 08<sup>th</sup> 2024, Michael A. Ayele (a.k.a) W has learned from representatives of OSF that journal articles published on their platform (OSF) could be filtered and distorted on ISE such as AOL, Bing/MSN and Yahoo to the displeasure of the author. OSF have also informed Michael A. Ayele (a.k.a) W that they could not make any guarantees on journal articles published on their platforms appearing &ldquo;<em>as is&rdquo; </em>on ISE such as AOL, Bing/MSN and Yahoo. Michael A. Ayele (a.k.a) W was annoyed upon finding out that his journal article with the Digital Object Identifier (DOI).: 10.17605/OSF.IO/WMGJT</span> <span>had gone on to be filtered and distorted on the AOL and Bing/MSN ISE. Unfortunately, this is not the first time a journal article published on the OSF platform pertaining to American post-secondary academic education with regards to affirmative and effective consent (in healthy sexual relationships) has gone on to be filtered and distorted. Indeed, the first journal published on OSF that had gone to be filtered and distorted by ISE such as AOL, Yahoo and Bing / MSN had been assigned DOI.: 10.17605/OSF.IO/48M6Y. <span>According to information posted on the website of DataCite Commons, journal articles published or added on the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) &ndash; Zenodo, Figshare, Open Science Framework (OSF) and ORCID &ldquo;<em>maximize their usefulness (&hellip;) for the entire research and scholarly communications community&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>when the data is not modified &ldquo;<em>so as to make it false, incomplete, defamatory, or misleading.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Based on the statements made by DataCiteCommons, it has become obvious to Michael A. Ayele (a.k.a) W that his journal article with the DOI.: </span>10.17605/OSF.IO/WMGJT<span> will not be maximizing its usefulness on OSF either in the short-term or in the long-term future.&nbsp;Michael A. Ayele (a.k.a) W would like to take this opportunity to clarify that no binding contractual agreements exist between him and ISE such as AOL, Bing/MSN and Yahoo which gives them the right to make unsolicited comments upon the journal articles he has published on OSF. <br><br>Michael A. Ayele (a.k.a) W is a Bachelor of Arts (B.A) Degree graduate of Westminster College (located in Fulton, Missouri) who was in January 2010 informed about the April 05<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;1986 rape and murder of Jeanne Ann Clery before being told what constitutes &ldquo;<em>affirmative and effective consent</em>&rdquo; in healthy sexual relationships. Via email dated March 07<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;2022, the Department of Justice (DOJ) Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have informed Michael A. Ayele (a.k.a) W that (his alma mater) Westminster College had extended an invitation to their then Director William Webster to &ldquo;<em>deliver the 1987 Commencement Address on Sunday, May 17<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;1987 at 2:30 P.M.</em>&rdquo; The invitation extended by Westminster College on August 29<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;1986 came approximately 5 months after the April 05<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;1986 rape and murder of Jeanne Ann Clery on the campus of Lehigh University (located in the State of Pennsylvania). In other emails beginning November 12<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;2020, the FBI had informed Michael A. Ayele (a.k.a) W that they had transferred the case of Jeanne Ann Clery rape and murder to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) on (or around) June 11<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;1992. However, via postal mail correspondence that was addressed to Michael A. Ayele (a.k.a) W, the CIA have denied ever being &ldquo;<em>assigned</em>&rdquo; the case of Jeanne Ann Clery on (or around) June 11<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;1992. It is the opinion of Michael A. Ayele (a.k.a) W that the letters sent to him by the FBI (beginning November 12<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;2020) and the CIA (on or around May 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;2021) were inconsistent with one another. For your information, William Webster was Director of the FBI from 1978 to 1987. He was also Director of the CIA from 1987 to 1991. His father Thomas Webster is an alumnus of Westminster College (Fulton, Missouri). According to the 2019 &ndash; 2020 Student Handbook published by Westminster College (Fulton, Missouri), &ldquo;<em>the college has comprehensive, intentional, and integrated programming, initiatives, strategies, and campaigns that are intended to end sexual misconduct, dating / domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking. Programs to prevent sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking include both primary prevention and awareness programs directed at incoming students and new employees and ongoing prevention and awareness campaigns directed at students and employees. The ongoing educational programs are overseen by the Title IX Coordinator / Director of Human Resources and Vice-President / Dean of Student Life. All prevention programs are [1] culturally relevant, inclusive of diverse communities and identities, sustainable, responsive to community needs, and empirically based and assessed for value, effectiveness, or outcome; [2] in consideration of environmental risk and protective factors as they occur on the individual relationship, institutional community and societal levels; [3] accessible to students, faculty and staff and accommodated based upon one&rsquo;s ability status, language, and/or learning style.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;</span><br><br><span>The key questions asked by Michael A. Ayele (a.k.a) W about the rape and murder of Jeanne Ann Clery as well as Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 include but are not limited to the following. 1) What were American colleges and universities obligations pursuant to Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972? Were American colleges and universities required by law to condemn violence committed against women irrespective of their racial backgrounds, their sexual orientations, their religious affiliations, their national origins and/or their disability status following the enactment of Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972? If yes, were American colleges and universities required to inform their students (beginning Calendar Year 1973) what constitutes appropriate sexual boundaries pursuant to Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972? 2) Did American colleges and universities begin informing their students what constitute &ldquo;<em>affirmative and effective consent</em>&rdquo; in the years following the enactment of Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972? If not, when did American colleges and universities begin to inform their incoming freshmen and transfer students about the concepts of &ldquo;<em>affirmative and effective consent</em>?&rdquo; Did American colleges and universities begin teaching the concepts of &ldquo;<em>affirmative and effective consent</em>&rdquo; to their students following the rape and murder of Jeanne Ann Clery (on April 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;1986)? If yes, why have American colleges and universities waited so long following the enactment of Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 to inform their students what constitutes &ldquo;<em>affirmative and effective consent</em>?&rdquo; 3) Are American colleges and universities discussions pertaining to what constitutes &ldquo;<em>affirmative and effective consent</em>&rdquo; consistent with Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 if they are first informing their incoming new students about the rape and murder of Jeanne Ann Clery? Are American colleges and universities discussions pertaining to what constitutes &ldquo;<em>affirmative and effective consent</em>&rdquo; consistent with their academic integrity policy if they are first informing their incoming new students about the rape and murder of Jeanne Ann Clery? 4) Were there forces out there in the 1970s and the 1980s looking for a case where a Black or an African American man rapes and murders a Caucasian woman for the purpose of enacting a law similar to the Jeanne Clery Act? Was the enactment of the Jeanne Clery Act the result of racist and sexist individuals coming together for the purpose of [a] preventing racial minorities from climbing the social ladder through academic education; [b] cracking down on interracial relationships particularly between a Caucasian woman and a Black or African American man (in American colleges and universities); [c] not applying the same standards in circumstances where a Caucasian man sexually assaults a woman from a racial minority (as in the case of Brock Turner and Chanel Miller following her rape on January 18<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;2015 at the campus of Stanford University)?</span><br><br><span>As a matter of principle, Michael A. Ayele (a.k.a) W unequivocally condemns violence committed against girls and women irrespective of their racial backgrounds, their sexual orientations, their national origins, their religious affiliations, their disability status or their age groups. Still, Michael A. Ayele (a.k.a) W is vexed by the very bizarre and persistent frenzy that has targeted him on the internet ever since he made the decision to publish on digital platforms [1] some of his recollections on how he was in the month of January 2010 (as an undergraduate student of Westminster College) informed about the April 05<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;1986 rape and murder of Jeanne Ann Clery before being told what constitutes affirmative and effective consent in healthy sexual relationships; [2] his questions about Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972; [3] his correspondence with agents of the U.S government on the circumstances that led up to the enactment of the Jeanne Clery Act on (or around) November 08<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;1990; [4] his inquiry on the exact year American colleges and universities began teaching their undergraduate students what constitutes affirmative and effective consent in healthy sexual relationships&hellip;&nbsp;Michael A. Ayele (a.k.a) W takes full-responsibility for all the statements he has made at the time he decided to publish his review of events that led to the Jeanne Clery Act. Michael A. Ayele (a.k.a) W also takes full-responsibility for the questions he has asked about Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972. <span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><br></span><strong><br></strong><span>According to a December 27<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;2023 complaint filed by the New York Times (NYT), Microsoft and OpenAI generative artificial intelligence (&ldquo;GENAI&rdquo;) tools rely on large-language models (&ldquo;LLMs&rdquo;) that were built &ldquo;<em>by copying and using millions of NYT copyrighted news articles, in-depth investigations, opinion pieces, reviews, how-to guides and more. (&hellip;) Through Microsoft&rsquo;s Bing Chat (recently rebranded as &lsquo;Copilot&rsquo;) and OpenAI&rsquo;s ChatGPT, both Microsoft and OpenAI seek to free-ride on the NYT massive investment in its journalism by using it to build substitutive product without permission or payment. (&hellip;) At the same time as Microsoft and OpenAI models are copying, reproducing, and paraphrasing NYT content without consent or compensation, they are also causing the NYT commercial and competitive injury by misattributing content to the NYT that it did not, in fact, publish. In AI parlance, this is called a &lsquo;hallucination.&rsquo; In plain English, it&rsquo;s misinformation. ChatGPT defines a &rsquo;hallucination&rsquo; as the &lsquo;phenomenon of a machine, such as a chatbot, generating seemingly realistic sensory experiences that do not correspond to any real-world input.&rsquo; Instead of saying, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; Microsoft and OpenAI GPT models will confidently provide information that is, at best, not quite accurate, and, at worst, demonstrably (but not recognizably) false. And human reviewers find it very difficult to distinguish &lsquo;hallucinations&rsquo; from truthful output. These &lsquo;hallucinations&rsquo; mislead users as to the source of the information they are obtaining, leading them to incorrectly believe that the information provided has been vetted and published by the NYT. Users who ask a search engine what the NYT has written on a subject should be provided with neither an unauthorized copy nor an inaccurate forgery of a NYT article, but a link to the article itself.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em><em><br><br></em>The NYT have also noted in their December 27<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;2023 complaint that<em>&nbsp;&ldquo;it&nbsp;takes enormous resources to publish, on average, more than 250 original articles every day. Many of these articles take months &ndash; and sometimes longer &ndash; to report. That output is the work of approximately 5,800 full-time equivalent Times employees (as of December 31<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;2022), some 2,600 of whom are directly involved in the Time&rsquo;s journalism operation. Quite often, the most vital news reporting for society is the most resource-intensive. Some of The Time&rsquo;s most important journalism requires deploying teams of journalists at great cost to report on the ground around the world, providing best-in-class-security and support, filing lawsuits against government entities to bring information to light, and supporting journalists through investigations that can take months or years. (&hellip;) Making great journalism is harder than ever. Over the past two decades, the traditional business models that supported quality journalism have collapsed, forcing the shuttering of newspapers all over the country. It has become more difficult for the public to sort fact from fiction in today&rsquo;s information ecosystem, as misinformation floods the internet, television, and other media. If The Times and other news organizations cannot produce and protect their independent journalism, there will be a vacuum that no computer or artificial intelligence can fill. The protection of the Time&rsquo;s intellectual property is critical to its continued ability to fund world-class journalism in the public interest. If The Times and its peers cannot control the use of their content, their ability to monetize that content will be harmed. With less revenue, news organizations will have fewer journalists able to dedicate time and resources to important, in-depth stories, which creates a risk that those stories will go untold. Less journalism will be produced and the cost to society will be enormous. The Times depends on its exclusive rights of reproduction, adaptation, publication, performance, and display under copyright law to resist these forces. (&hellip;) The Times requires third parties to obtain permission before using Times content and trademarks for commercial purposes, and for decades The Times has licensed its content under negotiated licensing agreements. These agreements help ensure that The Times controls how, where, and for how long its content and brand appears and that it receives fair compensation for third-party use. Third-parties, including large tech platforms, pay The Times significant royalties under these agreements in exchange for the right to use Times content for narrowly defined purposes. The agreements prohibit uses beyond those authorized purposes. (&hellip;) In 2019, the Times published a Pulitzer-prize winning, five-part series on predatory lending in New York City&rsquo;s taxi industry. The 18-month investigation included 600 interviews, with more than 100 records requests, large scale data analysis, and the review of thousands of pages of internal bank records and other documents, and ultimately led to criminal probes and the enactment of new laws to prevent future abuse. OpenAI had no role in the creation of this content, yet with minimal prompting, will recite large portions of it verbatim.&rdquo; If you wish, you may access the full complaint filed by the NYT here.:&nbsp;</em>If you wish, you may access the full complaint filed by the NYT here.:&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><a href=\"https://nytco-assets.nytimes.com/2023/12/NYT_Complaint_Dec2023.pdf\"><span>https://nytco-assets.nytimes.com/2023/12/NYT_Complaint_Dec2023.pdf</span></a></span><span>&nbsp; .&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;</em><em><br></em></span><strong><span><br></span></strong><span>Be well.

As of September 22<sup>nd</sup> 2017, colleges can adopt various standards of proof in sexual assault cases, from the lowest standard of proof (preponderance of evidence) to a higher standard of proof (clear and convincing evidence).

Ayele (a.k.a) W that (his alma mater) Westminster College had extended an invitation to their then Director William Webster to &ldquo;<em>deliver the 1987 Commencement Address on Sunday, May 17<sup>th</sup> 1987 at 2:30 P.M.</em>&rdquo; The invitation extended by Westminster College on August 29<sup>th</sup> 1986 came approximately 5 months after the April 05<sup>th</sup> 1986 rape and murder of Jeanne Ann Clery on the campus of Lehigh University (located in the State of Pennsylvania). In other emails beginning November 12<sup>th</sup> 2020, the FBI had informed Michael A. Ayele (a.k.a) W that they had transferred the case of Jeanne Ann Clery rape and murder to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) on (or around) June 11<sup>th</sup> 1992. However, via postal mail correspondence that was addressed to Michael A. Ayele (a.k.a) W, the CIA have denied ever being &ldquo;<em>assigned</em>&rdquo; the case of Jeanne Ann Clery on (or around) June 11<sup>th</sup> 1992. It is the opinion of Michael A. Ayele (a.k.a) W that the letters sent to him by t<span>he FBI (beginning November 12<sup>th</sup> 2020) and the CIA (on or around May 21<sup>st</sup> 2021) were inconsistent with one another. For your information, William Webster was Director of the FBI from 1978 to 1987. He was also Director of the CIA from 1987 to 1991. His father Thomas Webster is an alumnus of Westminster College (Fulton, Missouri). <br><br>According to the 2019 &ndash; 2020 Student Handbook published by Westminster College (Fulton, Missouri), &ldquo;<em>the college has comprehensive, intentional, and integrated programming, initiatives, strategies, and campaigns that are intended to end sexual misconduct, dating / domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking. Programs to prevent sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking include both primary prevention and awareness programs directed at incoming students and new employees and ongoing prevention and awareness campaigns directed at students and employees. The ongoing educational programs are overseen by the Title IX Coordinator / Director of Human Resources and Vice-President / Dean of Student Life. All prevention programs are [1] culturally relevant, inclusive of diverse communities and identities, sustainable, responsive to community needs, and empirically based and assessed for value, effectiveness, or outcome; [2] in consideration of environmental risk and protective factors as they occur on the individual relationship, institutional community and societal levels; [3] accessible to students, faculty and staff and accommodated based upon one&rsquo;s ability status, language, and/or learning style.&rdquo;</em></span></span><em><span> </span></em><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><br><span><br></span>The key questions asked by Michael A. Ayele (a.k.a) W about the rape and murder of Jeanne Ann Clery as well as Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 include but are not limited to the following. 1) What were American colleges and universities obligations pursuant to Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972? Were American colleges and universities required by law to condemn violence committed against women irrespective of their racial backgrounds, their sexual orientations, their religious affiliations, their national origins and/or their disability status following the enactment of Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972? If yes, were American colleges and universities required to inform their students (beginning Calendar Year 1973) what constitutes appropriate sexual boundaries pursuant to Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972? 2) Did American colleges and universities begin informing their students what constitute &ldquo;<em>affirmative and effective consent</em>&rdquo; in the years following the enactment of Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972? If not, when did American colleges and universities begin to inform their incoming freshmen and transfer students about the concepts of &ldquo;<em>affirmative and effective consent</em>?&rdquo; Did American colleges and universities begin teaching the concepts of &ldquo;<em>affirmative and effective consent</em>&rdquo; to their students following the rape and murder of Jeanne Ann Clery (on April 5<sup>th</sup> 1986)? If yes, why have American colleges and universities waited so long following the enactment of Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 to inform their students what constitutes &ldquo;<em>affirmative and effective consent</em>?&rdquo; 3) Are American colleges and universities discussions pertaining to what constitutes &ldquo;<em>affirmative and effective consent</em>&rdquo; consistent with Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 if they are first informing their incoming new students about the rape and murder of Jeanne Ann Clery? Are American colleges and universities discussions pertaining to what constitutes &ldquo;<em>affirmative and effective consent</em>&rdquo; consistent with their academic integrity policy if they are first informing their incoming new students about the rape and murder of Jeanne Ann Clery? 4) Were there forces out there in the 1970s and the 1980s looking for a case where a Black or an African American man rapes and murders a Caucasian woman for the purpose of enacting a law similar to the Jeanne Clery Act? Was the enactment of the Jeanne Clery Act the result of racist and sexist individuals coming together for the purpose of [a] preventing racial minorities from climbing the social ladder through academic education; [b] cracking down on interracial relationships particularly between a Caucasian woman and a Black or African American man (in American colleges and universities); [c] not applying the same standards in circumstances where a Caucasian man sexually assaults a woman from a racial minority (as in the case of Brock Turner and Chanel Miller following her rape on January 18<sup>th</sup> 2015 at the campus of Stanford University)?<br><br>As a matter of principle, Michael A. Ayele (a.k.a) W unequivocally condemns violence committed against girls and women irrespective of their racial backgrounds, their sexual orientations, their national origins, their religious affiliations, their disability status or their age groups. Still, Michael A. Ayele (a.k.a) W is vexed by the very bizarre and persistent frenzy that has targeted him on the internet ever since he made the decision to publish on digital platforms [1] some of his recollections on how he was in the month of January 2010 (as an undergraduate student of Westminster College) informed about the April 05<sup>th</sup> 1986 rape and murder of Jeanne Ann Clery before being told what constitutes affirmative and effective consent in healthy sexual relationships; [2] his questions about Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972; [3] his correspondence with agents of the U.S government on the circumstances that led up to the enactment of the Jeanne Clery Act on (or around) November 08<sup>th</sup> 1990; [4] his inquiry on the exact year American colleges and universities began teaching their undergraduate students what constitutes affirmative and effective consent in healthy sexual relationships. <span>Michael A. Ayele (a.k.a) W takes full-responsibility for all the statements he has made at the time he decided to publish his review of events that led to the Jeanne Clery Act. Michael A. Ayele (a.k.a) W also takes full-responsibility for the questions he has asked about Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972.</span><br><span><br><span>According to a December 27<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;2023 complaint filed by the New York Times (NYT), Microsoft and OpenAI generative artificial intelligence (&ldquo;GENAI&rdquo;) tools rely on large-language models (&ldquo;LLMs&rdquo;) that were built &ldquo;<em>by copying and using millions of NYT copyrighted news articles, in-depth investigations, opinion pieces, reviews, how-to guides and more. (&hellip;) Through Microsoft&rsquo;s Bing Chat (recently rebranded as &lsquo;Copilot&rsquo;) and OpenAI&rsquo;s ChatGPT, both Microsoft and OpenAI seek to free-ride on the NYT massive investment in its journalism by using it to build substitutive product without permission or payment. (&hellip;) At the same time as Microsoft and OpenAI models are copying, reproducing, and paraphrasing NYT content without consent or compensation, they are also causing the NYT commercial and competitive injury by misattributing content to the NYT that it did not, in fact, publish. In AI parlance, this is called a &lsquo;hallucination.&rsquo; In plain English, it&rsquo;s misinformation. ChatGPT defines a &rsquo;hallucination&rsquo; as the &lsquo;phenomenon of a machine, such as a chatbot, generating seemingly realistic sensory experiences that do not correspond to any real-world input.&rsquo; Instead of saying, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; Microsoft and OpenAI GPT models will confidently provide information that is, at best, not quite accurate, and, at worst, demonstrably (but not recognizably) false. And human reviewers find it very difficult to distinguish &lsquo;hallucinations&rsquo; from truthful output. These &lsquo;hallucinations&rsquo; mislead users as to the source of the information they are obtaining, leading them to incorrectly believe that the information provided has been vetted and published by the NYT. Users who ask a search engine what the NYT has written on a subject should be provided with neither an unauthorized copy nor an inaccurate forgery of a NYT article, but a link to the article itself.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em><em><br><br></em>The NYT have also noted in their December 27<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;2023 complaint that<em>&nbsp;&ldquo;it&nbsp;takes enormous resources to publish, on average, more than 250 original articles every day. Many of these articles take months &ndash; and sometimes longer &ndash; to report. That output is the work of approximately 5,800 full-time equivalent Times employees (as of December 31<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;2022), some 2,600 of whom are directly involved in the Time&rsquo;s journalism operation. Quite often, the most vital news reporting for society is the most resource-intensive. Some of The Time&rsquo;s most important journalism requires deploying teams of journalists at great cost to report on the ground around the world, providing best-in-class-security and support, filing lawsuits against government entities to bring information to light, and supporting journalists through investigations that can take months or years. (&hellip;) Making great journalism is harder than ever. Over the past two decades, the traditional business models that supported quality journalism have collapsed, forcing the shuttering of newspapers all over the country. It has become more difficult for the public to sort fact from fiction in today&rsquo;s information ecosystem, as misinformation floods the internet, television, and other media. If The Times and other news organizations cannot produce and protect their independent journalism, there will be a vacuum that no computer or artificial intelligence can fill. The protection of the Time&rsquo;s intellectual property is critical to its continued ability to fund world-class journalism in the public interest. If The Times and its peers cannot control the use of their content, their ability to monetize that content will be harmed. With less revenue, news organizations will have fewer journalists able to dedicate time and resources to important, in-depth stories, which creates a risk that those stories will go untold. Less journalism will be produced and the cost to society will be enormous. The Times depends on its exclusive rights of reproduction, adaptation, publication, performance, and display under copyright law to resist these forces. (&hellip;) The Times requires third parties to obtain permission before using Times content and trademarks for commercial purposes, and for decades The Times has licensed its content under negotiated licensing agreements. These agreements help ensure that The Times controls how, where, and for how long its content and brand appears and that it receives fair compensation for third-party use. Third-parties, including large tech platforms, pay The Times significant royalties under these agreements in exchange for the right to use Times content for narrowly defined purposes. The agreements prohibit uses beyond those authorized purposes. (&hellip;) In 2019, the Times published a Pulitzer-prize winning, five-part series on predatory lending in New York City&rsquo;s taxi industry. The 18-month investigation included 600 interviews, with more than 100 records requests, large scale data analysis, and the review of thousands of pages of internal bank records and other documents, and ultimately led to criminal probes and the enactment of new laws to prevent future abuse. OpenAI had no role in the creation of this content, yet with minimal prompting, will recite large portions of it verbatim.&rdquo; If you wish, you may access the full complaint filed by the NYT here.:&nbsp;</em>If you wish, you may access the full complaint filed by the NYT here.:&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><a href=\"https://nytco-assets.nytimes.com/2023/12/NYT_Complaint_Dec2023.pdf\"><span>https://nytco-assets.nytimes.com/2023/12/NYT_Complaint_Dec2023.pdf</span></a></span><span>&nbsp; .&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;</em><em><br></em></span><span><br><span>Be well.

Please note that the <code>maps</code> directory can be mounted to see what map files are downloaded, and what map files were pre-seeded with the Docker Image. Other command line options are described in <a href=\"#cli-options\">CLI Options</a>.</p>\n<p>Commands below showcases the exampe usage of the tool.\n<strong>Steps:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pull the Docker image from DockerHub or <a href=\"CONTRIBUTING.md#build-docker-images\">Build Docker Images</a>:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>docker pull kaszanas/sc2infoextractorgo:latest\n</code></pre>\n<ol>\n<li>Place your <code>.SC2Replay</code> files in the directory which you want to mount as the input directory. The default directory for replays within the container is <code>/app/replays/input</code>.</li>\n<li>Pick one of the following commands.<ul>\n<li>Run the docker container and mount the entire directory:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>docker run -it --rm \\\n-v &lt;/path/to/your/directory&gt;:/app \\\nsc2infoextractorgo:latest -help\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>Run the Docker container and mount specific paths.\nReplace the <code>&lt;path&gt;</code> with the appropriate paths on your system:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>docker run -it --rm \\\n-v &lt;/path/to/your/replays&gt;:/app/replays/input \\\n-v &lt;/path/to/your/output&gt;:/app/replays/output \\\n-v &lt;/path/to/your/logs&gt;:/app/logs \\\n-v &lt;/path/to/your/maps&gt;:/app/maps \\\nsc2infoextractorgo:latest -help\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>When you execute the processing command, please note that you need to pass the appropriate paths to the tool that are withing the container. The default paths are:<ul>\n<li>Input directory: <code>/app/replays/input</code></li>\n<li>Output directory: <code>/app/replays/output</code></li>\n<li>Logs directory: <code>/app/logs</code></li>\n<li>Maps directory: <code>/app/maps</code></li>\n<li>Additionally the tool outputs some auxiliary files that can be used for debugging purposes. These are created in the main directory of the container <code>/app/</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!NOTE]\nIf you wish to see other files that are generated by the tool, you will have to mount the appropriate directories. The tool generates logs in the <code>logs</code> directory.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Example Usage (Local)</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!NOTE]\nThese steps assume that you downloaded the release binary or you will have to <a href=\"CONTRIBUTING.md/#build-from-source\">compile the tool from source</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Place <code>.SC2Replay</code> files in <code>./replays/input</code></li>\n<li>Run <code>SC2InfoExtractorGo.exe</code> as follows:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>SC2InfoExtractorGo.exe -input ./replays/input -output ./replays/output\n</code></pre>\n<ol>\n<li>Verify the output in <code>./replays/output</code></li>\n<li>If The output packages do not contain any processed replays, proceed to verify <code>./logs/</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>CLI Options</h2>\n<p>To see the full list of available options, run the tool with the <code>-help</code> flag:</p>\n<pre><code>SC2InfoExtractorGo.exe -help\n</code></pre>\n<p>The following flags are available:</p>\n<pre><code>  -help\n        Show command usage\n  -game_mode_filter int\n        Specifies which game mode should be included from the processed files\n        in a format of a binary flag: AllGameModes: 0b11111111 (default 0b11111111) (default 255)\n  -input string\n        Input directory where .SC2Replay files are held. (default &quot;./replays/input&quot;)\n  -log_dir string\n        Specifies directory which will hold the logging information.

(default 24)\n  -number_of_packages int\n        Provide a number of zip packages to be created and compressed\n        into a zip archive. Please remember that this number needs to be lower\n        than the number of processed files. If set to 0, will ommit the\n        zip packaging and output .json directly to drive. (default 1)\n  -only_map_download\n        Flag specifying if the tool is supposed to only download\n        the maps and not process the replays.\n  -output string\n        Output directory where compressed zip packages will be saved. (default &quot;./replays/output&quot;)\n  -perform_chat_anonymization\n        Flag, specifying if the chat anonymization should be performed.\n  -perform_cleanup\n        Flag specifying if the tool is supposed to perform the cleaning\n                        functions within the processing pipeline.\n  -perform_filtering\n        Flag, specifying if the pipeline ought to verify different hard coded game modes.\n        If set to false completely bypasses the filtering.\n  -perform_integrity_checks\n        Flag specifying if the software is supposed to check the hardcoded\n        integrity checks for the provided replays\n  -perform_player_anonymization\n        Flag specifying if the tool is supposed to perform player anonymization\n        functions within the processing pipeline.\n        If set to true please remember to download and run\n        an anonymization server: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5138313\n  -perform_validity_checks\n        Flag, specifying if the tool is supposed to use hardcoded validity checks\n        and verify if the replay file variables are within 'common sense' ranges.\n  -skip_map_download\n        Flag specifying if the tool is supposed to skip the map download\n  -with_cpu_profiler string\n        Set path to the file where pprof cpu profiler will save its information.\n        If this is empty no profiling is performed.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Dataset Preparation</h2>\n<p>If You have a pack of replays with nested directories and You would like to automatically flatten the directory structure, We have published a tool that can be used for that, please see SC2DatasetPreparator: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5296664</p>\n<h3>Anonymization (Optional)</h3>\n<p>In order to anonymize the replays please make sure to download and run our open-source implementation of an anonymization server the SC2AnonServerPy: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5138313</p>\n<p>This is required because of the multiprocessing nature of our code that needs to perform synchronization with an existing database of unique toons (player IDs) that are mapped to arbitrary incrementing integer.</p>\n<h3>Map Translation Support</h3>\n<p>Existing implementation downloads the maps from the Blizzard servers. This is to normalize the map names to English language. When there is no internet connection available, our tool should fallback to reading the map names from the files placed in the <code>./maps</code> directory.</p>\n<h3>Filtering Capabilities</h3>\n<p>Currently the software supports some game mode filtering capabilities which can be used with <code>-game_mode</code> flag.\nThe flag itself is a binary flag where <code>0b11111111</code> is all game modes which is the default.</p>\n<p>Other ways to set the flag:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>0b00000001</code>: 1v1 Ranked Games</li>\n<li><code>0b00000010</code>: 2v2 Ranked Games</li>\n<li><code>0b00000100</code>: 3v3 Ranked Games</li>\n<li><code>0b00001000</code>: 4v4 Ranked Games</li>\n<li><code>0b00010000</code>: 1v1 Custom Games</li>\n<li><code>0b00100000</code>: 2v2 Custom Games</li>\n<li><code>0b01000000</code>: 3v3 Custom Games</li>\n<li><code>0b10000000</code>: 4v4 Custom Games</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>License / Dual Licensing</h2>\n<p>This repository is licensed under GNU GPL v3 license.

Palavra que <br>demanda tradu&ccedil;&atilde;o, que pe&ccedil;a pela subjetividade, que tanto preocupa. Fonte de <br>prazer e mist&eacute;rio.

Esse artigo destina-se a todos aqueles, homens, mulheres e profissionais <br>da &aacute;rea da sa&uacute;de, que se preocupem com tal quest&atilde;o. &Eacute; objetivo refletir e <br>sensibilizar para a import&acirc;ncia, de forma real e n&atilde;o apenas did&aacute;tica, de um trabalho <br>s&eacute;rio, focado na mulher, que depois de tantas conquistas, merece um pouco de <br>prazer sexual e conhecimento sincero dos seus mecanismos e respostas sexuais. <br>Este trabalho desenvolve algumas id&eacute;ias a respeito do orgasmo. Levanta-se aqui <br>alguns breves conceitos sobre uma disfun&ccedil;&atilde;o feminina bastante conhecida e, n&atilde;o <br>sem tempo, estudada ultimamente: a anorgasmia. Como a gestalt-terapia v&ecirc; o ser <br>humano em constante mudan&ccedil;a e movimento, acredito que muito tem a contribuir <br>em rela&ccedil;&atilde;o a esta tem&aacute;tica.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In Part I, we noted that usual maximization of probability&nbsp; Product over i pi power (Npi) which yields Shannon&rsquo;s entropy does not apply to the Tsallis case. We then asked: What is&nbsp; maximized in the Tsallis scenario? This is the question we wish to investigate here.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We first note that Tsallis entropy is linked with a physical probability pi power q, where Sum over i p(i) = 1. In other words, if a probability should be maximized, one would assume that it is p(i) because this is the normalized probability. This, however, would be the usual Shannon maximization, usually with respect to the constraint Sum over i ei pi = Etotal. In the Tsallis case, the constraint is now associated with pi power q and pi, i.e. Sum over i ei pi power q = E. As a result, it seems that one cannot maximize a Shannon&rsquo;s entropy expression, although in the case of q=1, the Shannon result should appear because then the a priori constraint Sum over ei pi = E holds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, given that pi power q appears in the constraint, it seems that one should apply the same ideas that are applied in the Shannon case to the pi power q case, as argued in Part I, i.e. pi power q is the probability for i, then an overall probability of N trials: &nbsp; Product over i=1,N &nbsp; {pi power q} power {N pi power q} does not lead to Tsallis entropy, even though it yields Shannon&rsquo;s entropy for q=1. Thus, we argued in Part I, that the Tsallis approach does not maximize probability to the fullest, i.e. does not minimize information to the fullest. We, however, asked: Then what is being maximized?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We suggest that regardless of the distribution of pi, Sum over i pi = 1 holds. If pi&rarr; pi power q, then sum&nbsp; over i pi power q &lt;1 (for all pi &lt;1). This is an expression which mimics the a priori physical constraint:&nbsp; Sum over i ei pi power q, just as in the Shannon&rsquo;s case. Thus, extremizing an expression of the form Sum over i pi power q could lead to the Shannon&rsquo;s case as q&rarr;1+ delta, if one converts Sum over i pi power q to {Sum over i pi power q&nbsp; - &nbsp; 1} / {1-q}. A priori, however, one is no longer maximizing overall probability as a fundamental principle. Rather, one considers that instead of Sum over i pi, one has sum over i pi power q as a natural probability sum linked to the constraint. It is, however, not simply a matter of maximizing this expression, because the q=1 case must account for Shannon&rsquo;s entropy as a global maximization of probability.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, it seems that in the Tsallis q not= 1 case, one does not worry about maximization of global probability (minimal information), but only extremizes a function closely linked to the constraint such that q=1 yields Shannon&rsquo;s entropy. In other words, to a large degree one extremizes a probability (pi power q) which is similar to that in the ei constraint. In the q=1 case, pi is the probability in the ei constraint and so pi should appear in the entropy expression, and it does, but it is multiplied by ln(pi) (information) such that pi ln(pi) = ln( pi power pi) approx&ndash;?&nbsp; Ln ( ni power ni) approx= ln (n!). This in turn is linked with a maximum number of arrangements, i.e. minimal information. Thus, Tsallis entropy seems to be created by focusing on the q=1 case being the only one which really minimizes information and deliberately gains information for q not=1. Thus, non-minimal information states are suggested to exist in nature, with extra information not being due to a priori constraints, but to the Tsallis scheme of formulating a power function which only yields maximum probability (minimal information) in the q=1 case.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "description": "<p>The aim of the Gurdwara Reform Movement was to free the Gurdwaras from the clutches of the&nbsp;<em>Mahants</em>. In Sikh history, the Jaito Morcha was one of the peaceful Morchas of the Gurdwara Reform Movement. In these peaceful Morchas, both men and women who took bullets with open foreheads, to achieve peaceful martyrdom and protect religion, have contributed. The share of women in these Morchas was not less. Women also expressed the same sense of courage and bravery as men. After the first stage of the Jatha, when it became clear that women were not needed to prepare langar, the leader of the Jatha asked the women to go back. The other women agreed to go back after the leader of the Jatha asked them to, but Bibi Balbir Kaur did not wish to go back. She wanted to go with the Jatha. When the Jathedar asked her to go back, she said, \"Don't stop me from participating in this fight, I am not afraid of death. I request that I be allowed to go with my brothers.\" The Jathedar, understanding her feelings of sacrificing her life, reluctantly agreed. Bibi Balbir Kaur demonstrated courage in this Morcha, having feelings of devotion and respect for religion. She sacrificed her life along with her child for her religion and sect. It was because of the sacrifices and martyrdom that the British government of that time had to bow down and was forced to enact the Gurdwara Act. With the passage of the Act, the historical Gurdwaras came under the management of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee.</p>",

But seeing the Jatha of 500 leaving, doubts arose in the minds of the people that these brave persons would be able to fulfill their vow of remaining peaceful?
