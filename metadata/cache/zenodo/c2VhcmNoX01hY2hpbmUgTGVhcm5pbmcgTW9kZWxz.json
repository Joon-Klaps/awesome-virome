        "description": "<p>The concept of I = 0<br>0 as a fundamental constant challenges conventional math-<br>ematical and physical paradigms by offering an innovative framework to address<br>longstanding issues across multiple fields. This document explores the theoretical<br>foundation and practical applications of I in resolving critical problems in quan-<br>tum field theory (QFT), general relativity (GR), quantum mechanics, and machine<br>learning. In QFT, renormalization is essential to eliminate divergences inherent<br>in loop integrals; the introduction of I provides a novel perspective on regular-<br>ization techniques, potentially replacing arbitrary cutoff parameters with a unified<br>constant that encapsulates inherent indeterminacies. In the realm of GR, singular-<br>ities&mdash;points where classical descriptions break down&mdash;pose significant challenges,<br>particularly within black hole interiors and cosmological models. The application of<br>I in this context offers a promising avenue for obtaining finite, well-defined solutions<br>that can bridge the gap between quantum gravity and classical theory. Addition-<br>ally, this work examines the stabilization of machine learning algorithms, where<br>issues such as gradient explosion and vanishing gradients can hinder model train-<br>ing. Here, the use of I inspires new regularization and normalization techniques that<br>ensure robust learning and improved convergence. Finally, the analysis extends to<br>quantum mechanics, specifically in addressing the measurement problem through<br>the stabilization of the wavefunction collapse process, ensuring finite measurement<br>probabilities. By integrating these diverse areas, the study not only highlights the<br>potential of I as a unifying concept but also provides theoretical insights and practi-<br>cal methodologies that may lead to breakthroughs in understanding the fundamental<br>structure of reality and improving computational algorithms.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The \"Nebulocracy: Semi-Direct Democratic Government System Architecture\" introduces a visionary and intricate framework for a new form of governance known as Nebulocracy. This system is designed to seamlessly integrate advanced technology, robust ethical frameworks, and extensive citizen participation, aiming to create a more responsive, adaptable, and principled form of democracy. The research delves into the complex and multi-layered structure of Nebulocracy, which is intended to address the intricacies of modern governance while adhering to core ethical principles.</p>\n<p>At the heart of Nebulocracy lie five core principles that guide its entire structure and operation. The first principle is Ethical Objectivism, which posits that there are universal ethical truths that can be discovered and applied to governance. This principle serves as the foundation of the system's moral framework, ensuring that decisions are grounded in objective ethical standards. The second principle, Value Integration, recognizes the importance of incorporating the diverse subjective values of citizens into the governance process. This ensures that the system remains responsive to the evolving needs and beliefs of the population, balancing universal ethical principles with individual and cultural perspectives. The third principle, Adaptive Governance, acknowledges the rapidly changing nature of the world and designs the system to evolve and adapt to new challenges, technological advancements, and societal needs. This adaptability ensures that Nebulocracy remains relevant and effective over time. The fourth principle, Citizen Participation, emphasizes the importance of direct and continuous citizen involvement in the governance process. Unlike traditional representative democracies, where citizen involvement is often limited to periodic voting, Nebulocracy provides multiple channels for citizens to engage in decision-making processes, contribute their ideas, and shape the direction of governance. The fifth principle, Specialized Governance, recognizes that effective governance in a complex world requires specialized knowledge and expertise. Therefore, Nebulocracy divides governance into distinct branches, each focused on specific domains, to ensure that decisions are made with a deep understanding of relevant issues.</p>\n<p>The Axiological Framework is a crucial component of Nebulocracy, serving as the supreme governing body that ensures all governmental actions align with ethical principles and societal values. This framework consists of several interrelated elements, including the Moral Graph, Value Cards, the Ethical Values Integration System (EVIS), and the Axiological Oversight Council (AOC). The Moral Graph is a dynamic, multidimensional representation of the ethical landscape of society, visually mapping out how different values interact, their relative importance, and their application in various contexts. This graph is continuously updated based on new ethical insights, empirical data, and citizen input, ensuring that it remains current and representative. Value Cards are detailed articulations of specific values, principles, or ethical considerations that citizens, experts, and AI systems can propose. These cards are then evaluated and potentially integrated into the Moral Graph, allowing for a granular and nuanced understanding of ethical concepts. The Ethical Values Integration System (EVIS) is an advanced AI system that manages the Moral Graph and Value Cards, using sophisticated algorithms to process ethical data, update the Moral Graph, and provide real-time ethical analysis for decision-making processes across all branches of government. The Axiological Oversight Council (AOC) is an independent body of ethicists, philosophers, scientists, and cultural representatives that oversees the operation of EVIS and the overall ethical integrity of the government. This council reviews and validates new Value Cards, audits the Moral Graph for consistency and accuracy, and provides guidance on complex ethical issues. Additionally, the Peoples, Wants, Desires, Interests Sovereign Council (PWDISC) focuses on understanding and representing the diverse needs, aspirations, and interests of the citizenry, serving as a bridge between the ethical framework and the lived experiences of people. The Sovereign People's Health and Safety Council is dedicated to ensuring the physical and mental well-being of citizens, integrating health and safety considerations into all aspects of governance. The People's Enquiry Inquisition Branch On Needs Wants Desires Interests Agency serves as a direct channel for citizens to express their needs, wants, desires, and interests, conducting regular surveys, holding public forums, and using AI-assisted analysis to understand and articulate the will of the people. The General Government Advisors Agency Council brings together advisors from various fields to provide comprehensive guidance to all branches of government, ensuring that decisions are informed by a wide range of expertise.</p>\n<p>Nebulocracy's governmental structure is highly specialized and multi-tiered, designed to address the complex challenges of modern governance. It consists of several layers, each with specific functions and responsibilities. The Primary Tertiary Governmental Structure is composed of the Seven Omni Branches, each focused on a specific aspect of societal management. These branches include the Omni-Potent Branch, responsible for matters of national security, resource management, and emergency response; the Omni-Present Branch, focused on government accessibility and communication; the Omni-Amor Fati Branch, dedicated to fostering resilience, adaptability, and positive engagement with life's challenges; the Omni-Science Branch, overseeing scientific research, technological development, and evidence-based policymaking; the Omni-Beneficial Branch, focused on social welfare, infrastructure development, and environmental sustainability; the Omni-Benevolent Branch, dedicated to ethical governance, human rights protection, and the promotion of social justice; and the Omni-Kantian Branch, emphasizing rationality, moral duty, and respect for individual autonomy. Each of these branches has its own sub-parliament, allowing for specialized legislative processes within their respective domains, and operates as supraregional organizational superorganisms, coordinating activities across different regions and levels of government. The Secondary Governmental Structure includes the OmniCooperation Constitutional Cern People's United Clarity Parliament (OCCCPUCPCQ), also known as the Clarity Parliament, which serves as the central legislative organ, integrating inputs from all Omni Branches and ensuring that legislation aligns with the ethical framework and constitutional principles. The Omnipresent Central Government (OCCGPUC) is the central executive body, responsible for implementing policies and coordinating activities across all branches and regions. The 7 Prime Ministers Swarm Hive Mind Lead Cabinet is a unique leadership structure consisting of seven prime ministers, each aligned with one of the Omni Branches, working collaboratively as a \"swarm hive mind\" to provide overall direction and coordination for the government. The General Primary Governmental Structure includes foundational elements such as the Supreme Constitution, the highest law of the land, enshrining fundamental rights, principles, and the structure of government; the Supreme Constitutional Institution, responsible for interpreting and upholding the Constitution; the Presidential Constitutional Council (PCC), tasked with enforcing the Constitution and serving as its guardians; the Supreme Government Body Of Human Safety And All Human Flourishing And Thriving Institute (SGBHSAHFTI), focused on comprehensive human well-being and integrating considerations of safety, health, and overall flourishing into all aspects of governance; and the Supreme Constitutional Anti-Corruption Court, a specialized judiciary focused on preventing and prosecuting corruption within the government. The Hive Mind Superintelligence Individualistic Cooperative Swarms Collective Omni-United (HMSICSCOU) is an advanced AI system that supports decision-making across all branches of government, integrating diverse perspectives and vast amounts of data to generate optimal solutions. The Specialized Primary Governmental Structure includes a variety of specialized bodies and institutions that focus on specific aspects of governance, such as the Supreme All Knowing Overwatch Observatory, a high-level monitoring system providing comprehensive oversight of all government activities; the Supreme Freedom of Press Sovereign, ensuring and protecting freedom of the press and media independence; the Supreme Constitutional Human Rights Court, a specialized court dedicated to protecting and enforcing human rights; the Supreme Open Science and Logic Sovereign Council, promoting open scientific inquiry and logical reasoning in governance; and the Supreme Constitutional Dating Compatibility and All Personality Analysis Sovereign Science Council, applying scientific methods to understand personality dynamics and social compatibility, informing policies related to social harmony and personal development.</p>\n<p>Nebulocracy places a strong emphasis on active citizen involvement in governance through various mechanisms. The Citizen Engagement Platform (CEP) is a comprehensive digital platform that allows citizens to participate in debates, vote on policies, and contribute ideas to the governance process. AI-Assisted Voting Hubs are facilities that use advanced AI to provide citizens with comprehensive, unbiased information about voting issues, helping them make informed decisions. Citizen Moral Assemblies are randomly selected groups of citizens who deliberate on ethical issues and contribute to the development of the Moral Graph. Public Audits and Citizen Juries are regular audits and juries composed of citizens to evaluate government performance and ensure accountability. Participatory Budgeting processes allow citizens to directly allocate a portion of public budgets to projects they deem important. Town Hall Meetings are regular forums for direct interaction between citizens and government officials, providing opportunities for citizens to voice their concerns and engage in dialogue with decision-makers.</p>\n<p>Nebulocracy's economic model is designed to align with its ethical principles and promote universal well-being. The Eubioic Currency (EUB) is a digital, decentralized currency managed to promote ethical economic activities and overall societal well-being. Cybernetic Resource-Based Economics is an advanced economic planning system that uses real-time data and AI analysis to optimize resource allocation based on actual needs and ethical considerations. Catallaxy Blockchain Economics is a system that facilitates spontaneous market order through blockchain technology, allowing for more efficient and ethical economic interactions. Universal High Income (UHI) is an advanced form of universal basic income that aims to provide all citizens with resources for a high quality of life. Skill Validation Blockchains are a system for verifying and recording individual skills and competencies, promoting a meritocratic approach to employment and education.</p>\n<p>Nebulocracy leverages advanced technologies to enhance governance. AI-Driven Moral Graph Updates involve continuous analysis and integration of ethical data to keep the Moral Graph current and representative. A Blockchain-Based Governance Ledger is a secure, transparent record of all government actions and decisions. Neural-Symbolic AI Systems are advanced AI that combines symbolic reasoning with neural networks to assist in complex decision-making processes. A Computing Cloud Network is a distributed computing infrastructure that supports all governmental operations and citizen participation platforms. Augmented and Virtual Reality Interfaces are immersive technologies used to enhance citizen engagement and understanding of complex governance issues.</p>\n<p>While Nebulocracy heavily relies on advanced technology, it also incorporates mechanisms to function effectively offline. Physical Moral Graph Representations are tangible, interactive models of the Moral Graph displayed in public spaces for citizen engagement. Value Card Libraries are physical repositories of Value Cards accessible in community centers and government buildings. Offline Citizen Assemblies are regular in-person gatherings for citizens to discuss issues, vote, and contribute to governance processes. Paper-Based Documentation Systems are comprehensive paper records of all government actions, decisions, and citizen inputs as a backup to digital systems. Manual Decision-Making Protocols are established procedures for government branches to operate and make decisions without AI assistance when necessary.</p>\n<p>When compared to the governance systems of Finland, the USA, and China, Nebulocracy offers several unique features and potential advantages. Finland is known for its highly functional democracy, strong social welfare system, and high levels of citizen trust in government. Nebulocracy shares some similarities with the Finnish system in its emphasis on social welfare and citizen participation but goes further in its use of advanced technology for governance and its more specialized governmental structure. The United States has a federal system with separation of powers between executive, legislative, and judicial branches. Nebulocracy's Seven Omni Branches offer a more specialized and potentially more agile governance structure compared to the US system. Additionally, Nebulocracy's emphasis on direct citizen participation and ethical governance represents a significant departure from the primarily representative democracy of the US. China's governance system is characterized by a strong central government and a single ruling party. While China has been incorporating more technology into its governance, Nebulocracy's approach is fundamentally different in its emphasis on ethical objectivism, citizen participation, and decentralized decision-making. Nebulocracy aims to combine the efficiency often associated with centralized systems like China's with the freedoms and participation levels of Western democracies.</p>\n<p>Potential benefits of Nebulocracy include enhanced ethical governance through the comprehensive Axiological Framework, increased citizen engagement and more direct democracy, more specialized and potentially more effective governance through the Seven Omni Branches, greater adaptability to changing circumstances and emerging challenges, and potential for more evidence-based and rational decision-making through the integration of AI and scientific principles. However, implementing such a system would also face significant challenges. The complexity of the system could be difficult for citizens to fully understand and navigate. Heavy reliance on technology could pose risks in case of system failures or cyber attacks. Ensuring the ethical AI systems are truly unbiased and aligned with human values would be a monumental task. The transition from existing governance systems to Nebulocracy would likely be complex and face significant resistance. Balancing the universal ethical principles with diverse cultural values and individual freedoms could prove challenging.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, Nebulocracy represents a bold reimagining of democratic governance for the 21st century and beyond. By integrating advanced technologies, ethical frameworks, and extensive citizen participation, it aims to create a system that is more responsive, principled, and effective than traditional forms of government. While implementing such a complex system would undoubtedly face significant challenges, the core principles and mechanisms of Nebulocracy offer valuable insights for improving existing governance structures. The Supreme Constitutional Individualistic-Cooperative Collective Swarms Hive Minds Network Institution (SCICCSHMNI) and the Hive Mind Superintelligence Individualistic Cooperative Swarms Collective Omni-United (HMSICSCOU) are two key components of Nebulocracy that embody its commitment to leveraging collective intelligence and advanced technology for ethical and effective governance. Together, these institutions form a comprehensive governance approach that spans from day-to-day administration to long-term existential considerations, embodying Nebulocracy's vision of a highly advanced, ethical, and adaptive system of governance.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "description": "<div></div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>The major causes of electric power quality (PQ) problems are mainly due to the increased utilization of nonlinear loads, capacitor and load switching events, transformer energization, and occurrence of assorted faults at the distribution corridor. The problems often introduce harmonics and other waveform anomalies like voltage sags, voltage swells and interruptions along the power systems. A timely classification of such problems is important in understanding their impact on costly power system economy. The paper explores comprehensive review of PQ issues, operational concept of convolutional neural network (CNN) and its utilization in solving PQ problems. Novel deep learning (DL) approach using variant of DenseNet CNN technique in Keras API platform is deployed to extract the features of, and classify PQ problems. The proposed technique improves classification performance with an accuracy of 99.96%. It shows remarkable improvement over the traditional techniques in the literature which were 73.53% to 99.92% accurate for a period from 2018 to 2023. The most promising part of the method is the improvement shown in the classification performance when compared with that obtained in the literature. The technique can also be applied in real time to cater for real PQ problems.</p>\n</div>\n<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.11591/ijeecs.v38.i1.pp1-21\"></a></div>",

        "description": "<div></div>\n<div>\n<div>The growing demand for e-hailing services in Malaysia leads to increased competition among more than 20 licensed e-hailing service providers. Consumer satisfaction is a crucial factor influencing variables in the business organization, and understanding consumers&rsquo; perceptions is vital for service improvement. Reviews on e-hailing services are unstructured data and massive, making comparisons difficult. Thus, this study aims to classify Malaysia&rsquo;s e-hailing service reviews from Google Play Store and X using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM). Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) was performed using a two-staged method, applying LDA for aspect category detection and SVM for aspect sentiment classification separately. Fare, availability, comfort, time, and convenience are five predetermined aspect categories in this study. The LDA for English and Malay achieved a perplexity of -7.31 and -7.49, respectively. Besides, the accuracy scores of SVM for English and Malay are 86.32% and 62.97%, respectively.</div>\n<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.11591/ijeecs.v37.i3.pp2077-2086\"></a></div>",

        "description": "<div></div>\n<div>\n<div>We explore the emergence and growing significance of educational data mining, a field dedicated to extracting valuable insights from vast datasets gathered from diverse educational environments. Utilizing the experience API (XAPI) and the Kalboard 360 online learning platform, our research presents a novel behaviorally based student performance model that evaluates the influence of student interactions on academic results. We create reliable models for precisely projecting academic success by utilizing machine learning techniques including logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors (KNNs), support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, random forests (RF), and XGBoost. The outcomes show a notable increase in categorization accuracy. Through the personalization of instruction, formative assessment support, and proactive identification of each student's unique needs to maximize their learning experience, this approach holds the potential to improve educational processes.</div>\n<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.11591/ijeecs.v37.i3.pp2069-2076\"></a></div>",

        "description": "<div></div>\n<div>\n<div>The evolution of seismic data collection has been driven by the need for stations to capture large volumes of high-frequency signals continuously. These signals typically contain both seismic and non-seismic information. Previous research converted SEED data into CSV format and used principal component analysis (PCA) for feature extraction from the seismic dataset. Machine learning models were then employed, showing an improvement in identifying seismic and non-seismic events. This paper focuses on applying deep learning methods, specifically deep neural networks (DNN) and a hybrid model combining long short-term memory (LSTM) networks with DNN (LSTM+DNN). The proposed deep learning models demonstrate a notable improvement over traditional machine learning technique. Experimental results show a test accuracy of 99.24% using deep learning, compared to an average of 97.80% achieved with machine learning models, indicating a 1.46% enhancement in detection accuracy. This underscores the potential of deep learning in accurately detecting seismic events in real-time monitoring systems.</div>\n<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.11591/ijeecs.v37.i3.pp2058-2068\"></a></div>",

        "description": "<div></div>\n<div>\n<div>Speech interfaces provide a natural and comfortable way for humans to communicate with machines. Recognizing emotions from acoustic signals is essential in audio and speech processing. Detection of emotion in speech is critical to the next generation of human-computer interaction (HCI) fields. However, a lack of large-scale datasets has hampered the progress of relevant research. In this study, we prepare BANSpEmo, a demanding Bangla speech emotion dataset consisting of 792 audio recordings totaling more than 1 hour and 23 minutes. The recordings feature 22 native speakers and each speaker uttered two sets of sentences representing six emotions: disgust, happiness, anger, sadness, surprise, and fear. The dataset consists of 12 Bangla sentences, each expressed in these six emotions. Furthermore, a series of investigations are carried out to assess the baseline performance of the support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), and multinomial Naive Bayes models on the BANSpEmo dataset presented in this study. The studies found that SVM performed best on this dataset, with an accuracy of 87.18%.</div>\n<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.11591/ijeecs.v37.i3.pp2044-2057\"></a></div>",

        "description": "<div></div>\n<div>\n<div>Anticipating student performance has garnered significant attention in education research for offering early insights that enable timely interventions and personalized support, ultimately improving student success and retention rates. This research focuses on enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of student performance prediction models by employing a hybrid ensemble framework that integrates weighted feature selection with meta-learner-based approaches. A weighted feature selection method was employed to prioritize the most influential of the 23 parameters in the dataset, enhancing prediction accuracy while reducing the computational burden. These parameters were then used to build a hybrid ensemble model by combining base learners with meta-learners, systematically tuned using hyperparameter optimization. This approach aimed to further improve prediction accuracy by fusing multiple base learners, leveraging the strengths of different algorithms for more accurate predictions. The proposed hybrid model was validated across different features selected based on feature importance using random forest (RF). An accuracy of 98.38% was achieved when all 23 features were considered and an accuracy of 97.13 % was achieved when the top 10 features were used. The research highlights the significance of early prediction for prompt intervention and demonstrates how feature weighting can boost model efficacy.</div>\n<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.11591/ijeecs.v37.i3.pp2032-2043\"></a></div>",

        "description": "<div></div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>This paper presents a comparative analysis of fingerprinting and machine learning techniques for bluetooth low energy (BLE)-based localization. Two fingerprinting algorithms, namely fingerprint feature extraction (FPFE) and Bayesian estimation (BE), along with various machine learning approaches including support vector regression (SVR), ensemble learning, and instance-based learning, are investigated. The selection of techniques depends on the availability of training data or the fingerprint database, explored in both ideal scenario and real-world scenario. In ideal scenario where the system administrator can collect fingerprint data through users&rsquo; devices, FPFE emerges as the preferred algorithm, achieving superior performance with a mean error of 0.50 m. In the context of real-world scenario, where data collection from multiple devices is limited, the system administrator may gather fingerprint data for localization using one or a few specific devices. Our experiments reveal that when there is a scarcity of fingerprint data, BE and SVR exhibit acceptable performance, reaching a mean error of 1.785 m and 1.965 m, respectively.</p>\n</div>\n<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.11591/ijeecs.v37.i3.pp2021-2031\"></a></div>",
