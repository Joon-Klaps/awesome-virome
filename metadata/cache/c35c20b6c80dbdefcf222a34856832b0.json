It supports dependency management through either conda or Singularity, as detailed in the [run modes documentation](config/README.md#run-modes).\n\nPlease refer to the [full workflow documentation](config/README.md) for detailed setup instructions.\n\n> The documentation in this repository provides instructions for running VIPERA\n> with Snakemake <8. We recommend using Snakemake 7.32.\n> However, using Snakemake 8 is possible with minimal modifications (see the\n> [migration documentation](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/migration.html)).\n> For example, `--use-conda` and `--use-singularity` are deprecated in Snakemake 8,\n> and `--software-deployment-method conda apptainer` is the preferred way to provide the options. Additionally, SLURM support is only available after installing an\n> [executor plugin for slurm](https://snakemake.github.io/snakemake-plugin-catalog/plugins/executor/slurm.html).\n\n## Contributors\n\n[![Contributors figure](https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=PathoGenOmics-Lab/VIPERA)](https://github.com/PathoGenOmics-Lab/VIPERA/graphs/contributors)\n\n## Citation\n\n> \u00c1lvarez-Herrera, M. & Sevilla, J., Ruiz-Rodriguez, P., Vergara, A., Vila, J., Cano-Jim\u00e9nez, P., Gonz\u00e1lez-Candelas, F., Comas, I., & Coscoll\u00e1, M.

However, there is no integrated framework for the evolutionary analysis of intra-patient SARS-CoV-2 serial samples. Herein, we describe Viral Intra-Patient Evolution Reporting and Analysis (VIPERA), a new software that integrates the evaluation of the intra-patient ancestry of SARS-CoV-2 sequences with the analysis of evolutionary trajectories of serial sequences from the same viral infection. We have validated it using positive and negative control datasets and have successfully applied it to a new case, which revealed population dynamics and evidence of adaptive evolution.
