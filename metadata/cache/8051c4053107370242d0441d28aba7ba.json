        "description": "<p>Subject of research. The article provides the meaning of effective management, where its<br>direct impact on the success of the enterprise is determined. It is outlined that effective tools for<br>the development and functioning of business structures in conditions of sustainable development are<br>management functions, namely analytical, forecasting, and system planning. It was noted that one of<br>the important effective tools for the development and functioning of business structures in today&rsquo;s<br>conditions is GR&ndash;management in the formation of the management of an industrial enterprise. GR<br>(Government Relations) is outlined as the formation of relations of enterprises with power structures<br>and one of the components of their management.<br>Purpose of the study. It was noted that the essence of such a strategic partnership is long&ndash;term<br>cooperation between enterprises, the state and institutions of higher education in the context of a synergistic<br>effect. The methods, tools of GR technology and the main stages of GR management are outlined.<br>Research methods. When writing a scientific article, general scientific and special research<br>methods were used: description, analysis, generalization, and systematization.<br>Work results. The historical chronology of GR as a type of activity was studied. The peculiarities of<br>GR&ndash;management were noted in this study. The economic essence of the concepts of communication<br>management, PR, and lobbying is singled out and defined. Scientific approaches to the interpretation and understanding of the problem of communication management are defined. Concepts such as<br>GR and PR are distinguished, GR and PR are defined as the most important blocks of enterprise<br>communication management, which have different objects of managerial influence.<br>Conclusion. The subject, object, subject and main tasks of PR management are defined. It was noted<br>that combining the services of GR&ndash;management and PR&ndash;management will have a favorable effect on<br>the formation of relations between the government and business. As a conclusion, it is proven that the<br>formation of open, positive, reliable partnership relations using a large number of tools is the direct<br>purpose of GR&ndash;management of an industrial enterprise.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The subject of the study is the parsing of contradictions and anti&ndash;dumping measures regarding<br>subsidies to agricultural enterprises against WTO legislation.<br>The purpose of the study is to determine the features and tools for considering contradictions<br>and anti&ndash;dumping measures regarding subsidies to agricultural enterprises against WTO legislation.</p>\n<p>Research methods. The article uses the dialectical method of scientific knowledge, the method of<br>analysis and synthesis, the comparative method, and the method of data generalization.<br>Results of the work. The article analyzes the contradictions that arise when applying anti&ndash;<br>dumping and countervailing measures to agricultural products that receive state subsidies, from the<br>point of view of compliance with the norms of the World Trade Organization (WTO). It is studied how<br>national legislation aimed at protecting the domestic market from dumped imports clashes with WTO<br>rules on subsidizing agriculture. Special attention is paid to the classification of subsidies (green box,<br>yellow box, blue box) and their impact on the possibility of applying anti&ndash;dumping duties. Cases are<br>analyzed when anti&ndash;dumping measures actually eliminate WTO&ndash;allowed subsidies, creating unequal<br>conditions of competition, and ways to resolve these contradictions are considered.<br>The purpose of the study is to determine ways to ensure fair trade in agricultural products and<br>avoid abuse of anti&ndash;dumping measures.<br>Conclusions. Anti&ndash;dumping and countervailing measures applied to agricultural enterprises cause<br>significant controversy in the context of WTO law. Subsidies to the agricultural sector, common in<br>many countries, often become the subject of anti&ndash;dumping investigations and countervailing duties.<br>The problem lies in the complexity of determining a &laquo;fair&raquo; price and proving the fact of dumping or<br>the presence of harmful subsidies. WTO agreements contain positions that allow the application of<br>such measures, but their interpretation and application often cause disagreements. Controversies<br>arise around the methods of calculating the dumping margin and the volume of subsidies, as well<br>as determining the cause and effect link between imports and the injury caused to local producers.<br>Opacity in the application of methodologies and political pressure can lead to the abuse of these<br>instruments, violating the principles of free trade defined in the WTO. Resolving these contradictions<br>requires increased transparency and the development of clear, internationally agreed rules.</p>",

It is emphasized that the world&rsquo;s population is growing at an accelerated pace, which<br>requires a corresponding increase in the volume of agricultural products for food production. The<br>content of innovative breeding practices was investigated as a branch of agricultural production and<br>one of the effective innovative tools that can significantly affect the yield of agricultural crops, support<br>the quality of the natural environment, increase the efficiency of agricultural production and ensure the<br>improvement of socio&ndash;economic living conditions of the population in rural areas, which corresponds<br>to the successful development of the agricultural sector in the context of a two&ndash;vector innovative<br>model of its development. The advantages and disadvantages of each of the innovative breeding<br>practices are identified. It is noted that the presence of advantages has already been proven, and the<br>disadvantages are considered only potential and require long&ndash;term research. The conclusion is made<br>that each person should form a correct perception of information regarding the use of food products<br>containing GMOs and make their own conclusions and choices.</p>",

The study aims to determine optimal approaches to integrating strategic management into the decision&ndash;<br>making process regarding the adoption of innovations in construction.<br>The purpose of the article is to define and analyze the impact of current strategic management<br>concepts on the process of selecting strategic innovations in construction projects and their<br>significance for stakeholders. The study aims to assess the effectiveness of applying modern strategic<br>approaches to managing innovation processes in the construction sector. Special attention is paid<br>to exploring mechanisms for integrating strategic management into decision&ndash;making regarding<br>innovations in construction, considering economic, technological, and social factors. The possibilities<br>of optimizing strategic management to enhance the competitiveness of construction projects and<br>their adaptation to modern market conditions are examined.<br>The methodology of the study is based on a systematic approach to analyzing the impact of current<br>strategic management concepts on the choice of strategic innovations in construction projects. The<br>research relies on structural analysis methods, allowing the identification of interconnections between<br>management strategies and innovation implementation processes in the construction industry. A<br>comparative analysis method is used to assess the effectiveness of various strategic management<br>concepts and their adaptation to the specifics of construction projects. The analytical method is applied<br>to study practical aspects of implementing strategic innovations and their impact on stakeholders,<br>including investors, regulatory bodies, contractors, and end&ndash;users. The expert assessment method is<br>used to obtain generalized conclusions on the effectiveness of applying modern strategic approaches<br>to construction project management. The analysis of empirical data is conducted based on the<br>study of real construction projects implementing innovative strategies to determine key factors<br>influencing their success. The forecasting method is applied to assess the potential development of<br>strategic innovations in the construction sector, considering global market trends and changes in<br>the regulatory environment. The study employs both quantitative and qualitative analysis methods<br>to evaluate the dynamics of strategic innovation implementation in construction and their impact on<br>the long&ndash;term competitiveness of the sector. Additionally, content analysis of scientific publications<br>on strategic management in construction is applied, along with statistical methods to assess the<br>effectiveness indicators of strategic innovations. The comprehensive approach ensures the objectivity<br>of the obtained results and allows for the identification of optimal approaches to integrating strategic<br>management into the decision&ndash;making process for selecting innovations in construction projects.<br>The results of the study indicate a significant impact of modern strategic management<br>concepts on the choice of strategic innovations in construction projects.

        "description": "<p>Nursing is a profession with high job demands and irregular working hours, which often lead to conflicts between work and family responsibilities. This condition can trigger Work-Family Conflict (WFC), which negatively affects nurses' subjective well-being. Perceived Supervisor Support (PSS) is considered an important factor in mitigating the negative effects of WFC. This study aims to examine the influence of work-family conflict on subjective well-being and to investigate the moderating role of perceived supervisor support. This research employed a quantitative approach using a questionnaire method. A total of 132 nurses from private hospitals in South Lampung Regency were selected through simple random sampling. The instruments used in this study were the work-family conflict scale, subjective well-being scale, and perceived supervisor support scale. Data were analyzed using Moderated Regression Analysis (MRA) with the assistance of SPSS software. The results showed that work-family conflict had a significant negative effect on nurses&rsquo; subjective well-being. Furthermore, perceived supervisor support was proven to moderate the relationship between work-family conflict and subjective well-being. High levels of supervisor support were found to weaken the negative impact of work-family conflict on nurses&rsquo; well-being. In conclusion, work-family conflict can reduce the subjective well-being of nurses; however, this effect can be minimized through strong perceived supervisor support. These findings highlight the crucial role of supervisors in creating a supportive work environment to maintain the psychological well-being of nursing staff.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The subject of the study is the process of formation and evolution of the content of strategic<br>innovations in construction companies through the integrated lens of SMART management and<br>sustainable development principles. Special attention is given to defining the essence of strategic<br>innovations in the construction sector, their conceptual framework, and transformation mechanisms in<br>response to contemporary challenges. The study analyzes the role of SMART management as a systemic<br>approach to managing innovation activities, based on specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and<br>time&ndash;bound goals. It explores how the principles of sustainable development&mdash;particularly environmental,<br>economic, and social balance&mdash;impact the formation of strategic innovation solutions. The research aims<br>to establish a link between the effectiveness of construction company management, their adaptability,<br>and their ability to implement innovations in the context of long&ndash;term sustainability and competitiveness.<br>The objective of the article is to substantiate the theoretical foundations and develop conceptual<br>approaches to the formation and evolution of the content of strategic innovations in construction<br>companies, considering the integration of SMART management and sustainable development<br>principles. The study focuses on identifying key factors influencing the transformation of innovation<br>strategies and revealing mechanisms for construction enterprises to adapt to a dynamic market<br>environment. Special attention is paid to the role of modern management approaches in ensuring<br>the long&ndash;term sustainability and competitiveness of the industry through the implementation of<br>environmentally, socially, and economically justified innovative solutions.<br>The methodology of the study is based on systemic, comprehensive, and interdisciplinary approaches,<br>which allow for examining the process of formation and evolution of strategic innovations in construction<br>companies through the integration of SMART management principles and sustainable development.</p>\n<p>The work is grounded in the analysis of theoretical foundations of strategic innovation management,<br>particularly through the study of scholarly works, regulations, and international standards that govern<br>innovation development in the construction sector. To identify trends and patterns in the development<br>of strategic innovations, the comparative analysis method is employed, which allows for evaluating the<br>effectiveness of innovation implementation approaches in various companies and countries.<br>For a deeper understanding of innovation management mechanisms, a structural&ndash;functional approach<br>is used, which enables the identification of the interconnection between SMART management tools and the<br>implementation of innovations in the construction sector. An important stage involves empirical research,<br>which includes the analysis of data on the activities of construction companies, their development strategies,<br>use of digital technologies, as well as environmental and social initiatives. The application of economic and<br>statistical methods allows for assessing the level of innovation activity of enterprises, identifying key factors<br>influencing strategic decision&ndash;making, and highlighting promising areas for development.<br>Additionally, expert surveys and SWOT analysis are used to assess the strengths and weaknesses<br>of innovation development in construction companies, as well as the threats and opportunities in the<br>context of global sustainable development trends. Forecasting methods help to form scenarios for<br>the future development of strategic innovations, taking into account the influence of digitalization,<br>automation, and environmental challenges. The results of the study will be summarized to form<br>practical recommendations for optimizing innovation management in the construction sector. The<br>implementation of the conclusions will contribute to improving the competitiveness of construction<br>companies, enhancing their adaptability to changes in the market environment, and strengthening the<br>integration of sustainable development principles into strategic management.<br>As a result of the conducted research, the key aspects of the formation and evolution of strategic<br>innovations in construction companies, based on the principles of SMART management and sustainable<br>development, have been identified. It was found that the implementation of strategic innovations in the<br>construction sector is directly dependent on the digitalization of processes, the use of environmentally<br>friendly technologies, and adaptation to global market trends. It has been proven that SMART management<br>contributes to improving the efficiency of managing innovation projects by specifying goals, measuring<br>results, ensuring the achievability of strategic initiatives, and aligning them with sustainable development.<br>A conceptual model of the interaction between strategic innovations and SMART management<br>elements has been developed, enabling construction companies to respond quickly to challenges<br>and implement environmentally and economically viable solutions. Analysis of best global practices<br>demonstrated that companies integrating sustainable development into their innovation strategy<br>have higher competitiveness and financial stability.<br>The recommendations proposed for optimizing management approaches will contribute to the efficient<br>use of resources, enhance enterprise adaptability to market changes, and create conditions for the long&ndash;<br>term development of the construction industry in the context of global environmental transformation.<br>Conclusions. The study established that strategic innovations in construction companies are a<br>dynamic process, evolving under the influence of technological, economic, and environmental factors.<br>The integration of SMART management ensures effective planning and implementation of innovative<br>solutions, making them specific, measurable, and oriented toward long&ndash;term sustainability. This, in<br>turn, helps reduce risks, optimize costs, and increase the competitiveness of construction companies.<br>The trend analysis showed that sustainable development is not only a requirement of the modern market but<br>also a key factor in forming innovation strategies. Construction companies that implement environmentally<br>safe technologies, energy&ndash;efficient solutions, and the digitalization of management processes demonstrate<br>a higher level of adaptability to global challenges. The integration of ESG principles (environmental, social, and<br>governance aspects) plays a crucial role in encouraging businesses to develop responsibly.<br>Overall, the research confirmed the need for a comprehensive approach to strategic innovations<br>that combines technological progress, effective management, and environmental responsibility. The<br>results obtained can serve as the basis for developing new approaches to managing construction<br>enterprises in the context of contemporary global transformations.</p>",

The article uses the dialectical method of scientific knowledge, the method of<br>analysis and synthesis, the comparative method, and the method of data generalization.<br>Results of the work. The article identifies the principles of implementing innovative equipment at<br>a restaurant business enterprise. The most effective principles of implementing innovative equipment<br>at a restaurant business enterprise are identified.<br>Conclusions. The implementation of innovative equipment in the restaurant business is an important<br>factor in increasing efficiency, competitiveness, and quality of services. Successful integration requires adherence to a number of principles. First of all, a strategic approach is needed, which involves analyzing<br>the needs of the enterprise, the market, and technological capabilities. The equipment must meet the<br>development strategy and business goals. Economic feasibility is important. The cost of equipment,<br>installation costs, personnel training, and maintenance must be compared with the expected benefits,<br>such as reducing costs, increasing productivity, and quality. Technological compatibility with existing<br>infrastructure and software ensures smooth operation and minimizes risks. Training and adaptation of<br>personnel is a prerequisite. Personnel must be trained in the effective use of equipment and understand<br>its benefits. Monitoring and evaluation of results make it possible to determine the effectiveness of<br>implementation, identify problems and make adjustments. Compliance with these principles ensures<br>the successful implementation of innovative equipment, increasing competitiveness and improving the<br>quality of services in the restaurant business.</p>",
